# Refined Combat Balance Proposal: The Attrition Model

To reach the target of **3-7 rounds** per major encounter without increasing HP bloat, we must address the "Damage Floor" and the "Defense Ceiling." Currently, players hit too reliably and for too much guaranteed damage.

## 1. Armor as a Damage Buffer (Core Rulebook)
**Observation:** Armor DR is currently a flat subtraction. In a d100 system, this often leads to "all or nothing" damage.
**Proposed Rule:** **Armor Mitigation.** 
*   Armor DR is no longer just a flat number. It also reduces the **Degree of Success (DoS)** added to damage.
*   **Mitigation:** Subtract half your Armor DR (round down) from the attacker's Degree of Success.
*   *Effect:* Even if an enemy hits, their "impact" is dampened by armor, extending the time it takes to whittle down HP.

## 2. The "Reaction Exhaustion" Penalty (Core Rulebook)
**Observation:** Reactions are very powerful, but currently have no diminishing returns within a single round.
**Proposed Rule:** **Fatigue.**
*   The first Reaction in a round is at full skill.
*   The second Reaction in the same round takes a **-20 penalty**.
*   The third and subsequent Reactions in the same round are at **Disadvantage**.
*   *Effect:* This prevents characters from being "invincible tanks" and forces the party to share the burden of incoming damage, naturally lengthening the fight as they spend actions repositioning.

## 3. Capping Damage Modifiers (Talent Rule)
**Observation:** Stacking "flat" bonuses (+5 from Focus, +5 from Empower, +5 from First Strike) creates massive damage spikes.
**Proposed Rule:** **The Rule of Two.**
*   A single attack can only benefit from a maximum of **two** different Talent-based damage modifiers.
*   *Effect:* Players must choose their best modifiers strategically rather than stacking every T1 and T2 bonus onto every hit.

## 4. Degree of Success Recalibration (Core Rules)
**Observation:** Adding the full primary die value (tens digit) to damage scales very aggressively.
**Proposed Rule:** **Damped Success.**
*   Only add **half** the Degree of Success (tens digit / 2, round down) to weapon damage for *normal* hits.
*   *Critical Hits* still use the new "Max Damage" rule (Base + tens digit of Skill).
*   *Effect:* Normal hits become significantly lower in damage, making the "Attrition" phase of combat longer and making Critical Hits feel even more impactful when they occur.

## 5. Monster Reactions (Bestiary)
**Observation:** Players use reactions to survive; major bosses need them too to avoid being focused down.
**Proposed Rule:** **Legendary Reflexes.**
*   Bosses (Hrothgar, Kraken, Fenrir) recover **all** their reactions at the start of every round.
*   *Effect:* This ensures that "ganging up" on a boss doesn't immediately result in them being defenseless after the first player's turn.

## Simulation Impact Table (Estimated)
| Rule                 | Round Impact | Lethality Change |
| :------------------- | :----------: | :--------------- |
| **Armor Mitigation** | +0.5 to 1.0  | Lower            |
| **Reaction Fatigue** | +0.5 to 1.0  | Higher (Risky)   |
| **The Rule of Two**  | +1.0 to 2.0  | Lower            |
| **Damped Success**   | +1.5 to 2.5  | Lower            |
| **Boss Reflexes**    | +1.0 to 1.5  | Lower (for boss) |

**Estimated New Fenrir Duration:** 5.5 - 7.5 rounds.
**Estimated New Hrothgar Duration:** 3.5 - 4.5 rounds.
