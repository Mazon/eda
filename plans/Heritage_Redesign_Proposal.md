# Heritage Redesign Proposal

## Overview
The "Heritage" section is a vital part of character creation that grounds players in the grim-dark, Nordic world of Eda. The current list provides a great foundation of "weirdness" vs "normality," but needs mechanical depth and thematic renaming to match the tone of *The Age of Wolves*.

## The Heritage Template
To make each choice meaningful, every Heritage provides:
1.  **Flavor Text:** Connecting the character to the world lore.
2.  **Signature Trait:** A unique passive ability.
3.  **Heritage Skills:** Two skills where the character is automatically **Trained** (+10 bonus).
4.  **Burden (Optional):** A thematic drawback, primarily for supernatural heritages.

## 1. Hearth-born (formerly Commoner)
*The sturdy folk of the clans. You were raised to survive the frost, tend the fire, and hold the line.*
*   **Trait: Stoic Endurance.** Once per session, you can ignore all penalties from Exhaustion or Cold for one hour.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Survival** and **Crafting**.

## 2. Dvergr (formerly Dwarf)
*Born of stone and ancient frost. Your people are the master-smiths who once thrived in the deep halls, now mostly lost to the ice.*
*   **Trait: Unyielding.** You have +10 to MND checks to resist Intimidation, Fear, or magical influence.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Engineering** and **Appraise**.

## 3. Wild-walker (formerly Nomad)
*You belong to the wastes. While others huddle behind walls, you find your way through the blizzards of the Fjordlands.*
*   **Trait: Scout's Eye.** You cannot be surprised while in the wilderness, provided you are conscious.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Navigation** and **Nature**.

## 4. Warg-touched (formerly Half Wolf)
*The blood of the Great Wolf runs thin in your veins. You are more beast than man, a feral omen of the Wolf-Age.*
*   **Trait: Primal Instinct.** You have +10 to **Perception** and **Tracking**. You can see in low light as if it were bright light.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Tracking** and **Combat: Melee**.

## 5. Blighted (formerly Leper)
*You carry a slow decay. Whether a curse of the Old Gods or a rot from the black ichor, you are marked for a lonely life.*
*   **Trait: Deadened Nerves.** You gain +2 Armor DR (Natural) as your skin hardens and numbs.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Medicine** and **Investigation**.

## 6. Hollow-born (formerly Abomination)
*You were touched by the black ichor before birth. You are a living mutation, a fragment of the "Hollowed" force in human skin.*
*   **Trait: Ichor Siphon.** You can consume the black ichor of defeated Hollowed creatures to restore 1d10 HP, but doing so causes you to lose 1 **Mind Point** due to **Madness**.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Occult Knowledge** and **Intimidate**.
*   **Burden: Monstrous.** You start with a visible mutation. Most NPCs will be wary, hostile, or fearful on sight.

## 7. Umbral-kin (formerly Shadow)
*A fragment of the Eternal Night given form. You are pale, silent, and unsettling, as if you don't quite belong in the physical world.*
*   **Trait: Shadow Blend.** You have +20 to **Stealth** checks while in dim light or darkness.
*   **Heritage Skills:** Trained in **Stealth** and **Perception**.
*   **Burden: Sun-Sick.** You take a -10 penalty to all rolls while in direct sunlight.

## Starting Equipment (Flavor Items)
In addition to standard gear, your Heritage provides a unique item that reflects your past:
*   **Hearth-born:** A sturdy iron cook-pot or a carved wooden idol of a Hearth-God.
*   **Dvergr:** A masterwork whetstone (adds +1 to next damage roll after use, 1/day) or a pouch of "Deep-Salt."
*   **Wild-walker:** A hand-drawn map of a secret mountain pass or a weather-beaten compass.
*   **Warg-touched:** A necklace of predator teeth or a heavy cloak made of wolf pelt.
*   **Blighted:** A supply of heavy, lavender-scented bandages or a small bell to warn others of your approach.
*   **Hollow-born:** A porcelain mask to hide your mutations or a small vial of inert black ichor.
*   **Umbral-kin:** A sheer black veil or a shard of obsidian that never feels warm.

## Integration with Character Creation
*   **Nature vs Heritage:** Nature determines your raw potential (Ability Scores). Heritage determines your upbringing, innate traits, and starting social standing.
*   **Skill Economy:** Heritage provides 2 "Trained" skills. These are in *addition* to the 3 Trained skills granted by the standard character creation process.
