# Progression System Options (Low Bookkeeping)

The goal is to reward **Skills Used** and allow **General Growth**, without breaking immersion by tracking every action.

## Option 1: The "Campfire Review" (Recommended)
*   **How it works**: You track nothing during the session. At the end of the session (or during a Long Rest), the group does a "Campfire Review".
*   **Usage Mechanic**: Each player narrates 2-3 moments where they struggled or excelled. They gain +1 Skill Point (or an Improvement Roll) for the skills used in those moments.
    *   *Example*: "I held off the bridge against the orcs (Weapon Skill) and I bandaged Hodo's leg (Aid)." -> Improve Weapon & Aid.
*   **General Growth**: Everyone receives a fixed amount of "Free XP" (e.g., 5 XP) to spend on Talents or any Skill they want.
*   **Pros**: Zero bookkeeping during play. Encourages roleplay/debriefing. Ensures only "meaningful" usage is rewarded.
*   **Cons**: Players might argue about what counts as meaningful.

## Option 2: The "Crit & Fumble" Trigger
*   **How it works**: You only mark a skill for improvement when you roll a **Critical Success** (Double digits under skill) or a **Fumble/Critical Fail** (Double digits over skill).
*   **Usage Mechanic**: These events are rare (~10-20% of rolls) and memorable, so pausing to check a box feels like a reward/consequence rather than a chore.
*   **General Growth**: Completing an Adventure grants "Adventure Points" to buy Talents/Stats.
*   **Pros**: Exciting. Tied to dice luck.
*   **Cons**: High variance (lucky/unlucky players progress at different rates).

## Option 3: Objective-Based Training
*   **How it works**: Progression happens only during **Downtime**.
*   **Usage Mechanic**: Completing a quest gives "Training Weeks". You can spend these weeks to train skills.
    *   *Constraint*: You can only train skills you used during the adventure.
*   **General Growth**: You also get "Hero Points" to buy Talents instantly.
*   **Pros**: Very realistic. Simulates training montages.
*   **Cons**: disconnects improvement from the immediate action.

## Option 4: The "Token" System
*   **How it works**: The GM has a bowl of tokens. When a player attempts a risky or significant skill check, the GM tosses them a token (regardless of success/fail).
*   **Usage Mechanic**: At end of session, spend tokens to upgrade skills.
*   **Pros**: Tactile reward.
*   **Cons**: GM cognitive load.

## Recommendation
**Option 1 (Campfire Review)** is the best fit. It completely removes tracking from combat, ensuring immersion, but connects growth directly to what happened in the story.
