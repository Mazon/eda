# Progression Gaps

## 1. Undefined "Levels"
The user instructions mention "Levels 1-12", but the Core Rulebook contains no rules for "Levels".
*   **Missing**: XP Thresholds for each level.
*   **Missing**: Benefits per level (HP increase? Stat increase?).
*   **Implication**: Current progression is purely organic (spend XP when you get it), which conflicts with the concept of "Level 1 to 12".

## 2. XP Economy Issues
*   **Crit XP for Talents**: Gaining Talent XP only on Critical Hits (1-10% chance) makes progression highly random. A lucky player could advance 5x faster than an unlucky one.
*   **Failure XP for Skills**: Gaining Skill XP on failure is a classic BRP mechanic, but can lead to "skill farming" (intentionally using weak skills to fail and upgrade them).

## 3. Static Stats
*   **No Attribute Growth**: There are no rules for increasing Attributes (STR, CON, etc.).
    *   **Consequence**: HP and MP are static throughout the campaign (unless specific Talents like "Endurance Training" are taken). A Level 12 character has the same naked durability as a Level 1 character.

## 4. Talent Pyramid Pace
*   **Cost Scaling**: T1 (5 XP) vs T4 (20 XP).
*   **Pyramid Requirement**: To get a T4, you need 2 T3, which need 3 T2, which need 4 T1.
*   **Total XP**:
    *   4 T1 = 20 XP.
    *   3 T2 = 30 XP.
    *   2 T3 = 30 XP.
    *   1 T4 = 20 XP.
    *   **Total**: 100 Crit XP.
*   **Timeframe**: If you crit once per session, it takes 100 sessions to max out. Ideally, progression should be faster.
