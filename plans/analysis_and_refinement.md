# Rulebook Analysis & Refinement Plan

This document outlines the identified inconsistencies, vague mechanics, and areas for improvement in the Eda Core Rulebook.

## 1. Core Dice Mechanics & Consistency

### Inconsistencies in Success Types
*   **Critical Success**: Defined as rolling doubles under the skill value (11, 22...).
*   **Great Success**: Defined in the Rituals section as rolling `< 1/5 MND`.
    *   *Issue*: Having two different "special success" types is confusing.
    *   *Decision*: Standardize Rituals to use **Critical Success** (doubles) or **Degrees of Success** (DoS). Remove the 1/5th threshold.

### Parry Mechanics
*   **Contradiction**: Line 379 says "Opposed AGI check," while Line 676 says "Reduce incoming damage by Weapon Damage + DoS."
    *   *Decision*: Make Parry a **simple check** (like Dodge). A successful Parry reduces incoming damage by **Weapon Damage + DoS**.

### Defense Terminology
*   **Decision**: Standardize on the term **Defense** (instead of DR or Damage Reduction) across the entire rulebook.

## 2. Under-defined / Vague Mechanics

### Combat Talents
*   **Far Throwing (T2)**: "Throw humanoid 20m."
    *   *Decision*: Require a **Strength (Athletics)** check vs **Opposed Strength/Constitution**. Target takes 1d6 damage per 5m thrown.
*   **Brawler (T2)**: "Grapple check."
    *   *Decision*: Define as an **Opposed Strength** or **Unarmed Style** check.
*   **Shield Edge (T3)**: "Advantage against enemy pinned by shield."
    *   *Decision*: Use the **Immobilized** condition instead of "Pinned".

### Spells & Rituals
*   **Freeze in Place / Forest Entangle / Quicksand**:
    *   *Decision*: Standardize these spells to allow the target a **Constitution** or **Agility** check (as appropriate) to resist, using the caster's DoS as the difficulty requirement.
*   **Medusa Glare**: "Turn to stone."
    *   *Decision*: Define duration (e.g., 1d6 rounds) or a specific method to break the petrification (e.g., a hard Constitution check).

## 3. Environmental Hazards

### Falling
*   *Decision*: Add rules for falling damage (e.g., 5 damage per 3m fallen).

### Suffocating
*   *Decision*: Keep `CON / 10` minutes for calm situations, but require a **Constitution** check every round in high-stress situations (combat) to avoid gaining Exhaustion.
