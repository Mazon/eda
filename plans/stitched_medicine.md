# Stitched Medicine: The Science of Survival in Eda

## 1. Core Philosophy & Lore
*The gods may grant miracles, but a saw and a needle get the job done every time.*

In a world ravaged by monsters and harsh winters, the delicate arts of high magic and alchemy are luxuries few can afford. "Stitched Medicine" (or "The Butcher's Art" as detractors call it) emerged from the battlefields and the slums. It is practical, brutal, and undeniably effective.

### The "Scientific" Approach
Practitioners of Stitched Medicine—often called "Stitchers," "Sawbones," or "Flesh-Smiths"—reject the mystical reverence for the body. To them:
*   **The Body is a Machine**: Muscle is just cabling, bone is just strut-work, and blood is just fuel. If a part breaks, you fix it. If it's destroyed, you replace it.
*   **Pain is Information**: Pain tells you the nerves are still firing. It's a useful diagnostic tool, not something to be feared.
*   **Survival Over Comfort**: A patient who walks with a limp is better than a patient who rots in a grave. Aesthetics are irrelevant.
*   **The "Spark"**: Life is maintained not by a soul, but by the "Spark"—the bio-electrical and chemical impulses that keep the heart beating. Brews and shocks can reignite this spark even when it flickers out.

### Traditional Healing vs. The Stitch

| **Stigma**       | Revered, Holy                  | Feared, Taboo, Essential                    |

## 2. The Brews: Alchemical Cocktails
*If the blood is too thin, thicken it. If the heart is too slow, kick it.*

These are not potions brewed with stardust and unicorn tears. They are volatile chemical compounds, extracted from monsters, toxic plants, and industrial runoff. They are injected with massive, crude syringes or poured directly into open wounds.

### Common Brews & Mechanics

#### 1. Kickstart (The Red Jolt)
*A syringe of bright crimson fluid that smells of copper and lightning.*
*   **Ingredients**: Adrenal gland of a predator (Wolf/Bear), refined caffeine, trace amounts of gunpowder.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Immediate: Ignore all levels of **Exhaustion** for 1 hour.
    *   Boost: Gain +10 to **STR** and **AGI** for the duration.
    *   "The Spark": Can bring a character at 0 HP back to 1 HP (if death wasn't instant).
*   **Side Effect (The Crash)**: 
    *   When it wears off, gain 2 levels of **Exhaustion**.
    *   Must make a **CON check (Hard)** or take 1d10 necrotic damage (heart strain).
*   **Addiction**: Moderate.

#### 2. Numb-Juice (The Grey Sludge)
*A thick, viscous grey paste that smells like mint and rotting meat.*
*   **Ingredients**: Corpse-flower pollen, poppy milk, ground bone.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Immediate: User feels no pain. Immune to **Stunned** and **Shock** from injuries.
    *   Medical: Allows surgery to be performed without a "Pain" check.
*   **Side Effect**: 
    *   -20 to **DEX** and **AGI** (severe loss of coordination/numbness).
    *   User cannot feel if they are taking new damage (DM tracks HP secretly).
*   **Addiction**: High.

#### 3. Clot-Binder (The Searing Seal)
*A bubbling, amber liquid that hisses when exposed to air.*
*   **Ingredients**: Troll blood (acidic), tree resin, ash.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Immediate: Stops **Bleeding** instantly.
    *   Medical: Automatically stabilizes a dying character (stops death saves/bleeding out). No Medicine check required.
*   **Side Effect**: 
    *   Deals 1d10 **Fire** damage upon application.
    *   Leaves a hideous, burn-like scar (-5 **CHA**/Persuasion unless covered).

#### 4. Rot-Stopper (The Green Purge)
*A vile-smelling, chunky green broth.*
*   **Ingredients**: Mold from deep caves, purified alcohol, bile.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Halts the progression of any **Disease** or **Infection** for 24 hours.
    *   Advantage on CON checks to fight off disease.
*   **Side Effect**: 
    *   Severe nausea: **Poisoned** condition for 1 hour.
    *   Dehydration: Must consume double water rations.

#### 5. Berserker's Milk (The White Rage)
*A cloudy white liquid with red swirls.*
*   **Ingredients**: Rabid animal saliva, hallucinogenic mushrooms.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   User becomes **Fearless** (Immune to Frightened).
    *   +5 Melee Damage.
    *   Cannot distinguish friend from foe (must attack nearest creature).
*   **Side Effect**: 
    *   1d10 Psychic damage when it wears off.
*   **Addiction**: Very High.

### Addiction & Dependency
Using these brews takes a toll.
*   **Tolerance**: After 3 uses of a specific brew in a week, the beneficial duration is halved.
*   **Withdrawal**: If an addicted user goes 24 hours without a dose, they suffer Disadvantage on all **INS** and **CON** checks until they get a "fix" or detox (1 week of sickness).

## 3. Procedures: The Art of the Saw
*Don't worry about the leg. I have a better one in the jar.*

Treatments are categorized by their invasiveness and the "crude" nature of the tools.

### Tools of the Trade
*   **Bone Saws**: For amputations and accessing the marrow.
*   **The "Rig"**: A portable set of bellows, tubes, and glass jars for pumping fluids, air, or brews into a patient.
*   **Staplers**: Heavy-duty metal staples for closing wounds fast.
*   **Cautery Irons**: Heated metal brands to stop bleeding.

### Surgical Mechanics

#### The "Field Stitch" (Battlefield Repair)
*   **Requirement**: Needle & Thread/Wire. 1 Minute.
*   **Check**: Medicine (Routine).
*   **Effect**: Heals 1d10 HP.
*   **Cost**: Leaves a "Ragged Scar". The wound is ugly and might pull open if stressed (on a Critical Failure).

#### "Lop & Cauterize" (Amputation)
*   **Requirement**: Saw/Axe + Fire/Iron. 1 Round (Combat Action).
*   **Check**: Medicine (Challenge) or Strength (Hard).
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Instantly removes a limb affected by a terminal condition (e.g., Gangrene, Spreading Curse, Monster Venom).
    *   Stops the condition immediately.
*   **Cost**: 
    *   Loss of limb (obviously).
    *   Patient takes 2d10 damage from shock.
    *   "Phantom Pain": Permanent -5 to INS checks (can be treated with Numb-Juice).

#### "Grafting" (The Frankenstein Protocol)
*   **Requirement**: A "Fresh" donor part (harvested < 4 hours ago) + Surgery Kit. 1-4 Hours.
*   **Check**: Medicine (Extreme).
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Attaches a new limb/organ to replace a lost one.
    *   **Biological Graft**: Arm from a fresh corpse. Restores function after 1d4 weeks of healing.
    *   **Monstrous Graft**: Arm from a beast (e.g., Wolf Claw). Gains a natural weapon (1d6 dmg) but -10 CHA.
*   **Risk: Rejection Sickness**: 
    *   The body fights the new part. Patient must make a CON check daily for 1 week.
    *   Failure = The graft rots and falls off, dealing 3d10 damage and Infection.

#### "The Iron Lung" (Resuscitation)
*   **Requirement**: The "Rig" + Kickstart Brew.
*   **Check**: Medicine (Hard).
*   **Effect**: 
    *   Attempts to revive a character who has *just* died (within 1 minute).
    *   Success: Character returns to life at 1 HP with a permanent injury/quirk (e.g., "Cold Skin", "No Pulse", "Stutter").
    *   Failure: The body explodes/melts from the chemical overload.

## 4. The Underground Market
*You want the good stuff? Go see Old Marge by the river. Don't mind the smell.*

### The Supply Chain
*   **Scavengers**: "Grave-robbers" who harvest fresh parts and organs from battlefields.
*   **Brewers**: Disgraced alchemists, hedge wizards, and druids who have "lost their way" (or found a new one).
*   **Dealers**: Traveling merchants in unmarked wagons, back-alley fences in big cities.

### Reputation & Cost
*   **Currency**: Gold is good, but "Favors" and "Trade" are better.
    *   *Cost of a Brew*: 50-100 sp (expensive!).
    *   *Cost of a Graft*: 500 sp + You provide the part.
*   **"The List"**: Dealers keep a list of reliable customers. Being on "The List" gets you access to the *really* illegal stuff (Monstrous Grafts, prohibited poisons).
*   **Blackmail**: Stitchers often know their patients' darkest secrets (literally, what's inside them). This information is valuable.

## 5. Practitioners & Locations
*   **The City Barber-Surgeon**: 
    *   *Location*: A clean-ish shop front with a bloody basement.
    *   *Service*: Quick, efficient, expensive. "No questions asked."
    *   *Specialty*: Cosmetic repairs, discrete bullet removal.
*   **The Wagon-Doc**: 
    *   *Location*: A traveling wagon, shaking and rattling.
    *   *Service*: Cheap, risky. "Hold this rag and bite down."
    *   *Specialty*: Amputations, selling "Kickstart" to laborers.
*   **The Hedge-Druid ("Rot-Witch")**: 
    *   *Location*: Deep in the swamps or forests.
    *   *Service*: Barter only. "Bring me the eyes of a wolf."
    *   *Specialty*: Curing diseases, fungal grafts, herbal brews.

## 6. Rulesets: Dirty & Practical mechanics

### Sanitation Levels
The environment matters. Stitchers don't need a sterile lab, but a sewer is still bad.
*   **Clean (Clinic/Lab)**: No modifier.
*   **Dirty (Tavern table, Wagon)**: -10 to Medicine checks. Risk of *Minor Infection* (1d4 days to heal).
*   **Filthy (Sewer, Swamp, Battlefield mud)**: -20 to Medicine checks. High risk of *Sepsis* (See Disease rules).

### "Rough" Medicine Modifier
A player can choose to use "Rough" techniques to lower the difficulty of a check.
*   **The Gamble**: "I'm not washing my hands, and I'm using the rusty saw."
*   **Benefit**: Reduce the Difficulty of the Medicine check by one step (e.g., Hard -> Challenge).
*   **Cost**: 
    *   The patient takes immediate damage (1d10).
    *   The patient gains a scar or minor permanent cosmetic defect.
    *   Increased risk of Infection.

### "Jerry-Rigged" Healing
Using non-medical items for healing.
*   **Duct Tape / Tar**: Can stop bleeding (Routine check), but causes 1 damage per turn until removed properly.
*   **Vodka / Moonshine**: Acts as *weak* painkiller or disinfectant. (Removes 1 level of Infection risk, but causes Intoxication).

## 7. Integration with Core Combat & Health
*Make it hurt, make it work.*

### The "Stitched" Condition
A character who has undergone significant "Stitched" procedures (Grafts, multiple Brew revivals, or extensive scarring) gains the **Stitched** condition.
*   **Effect**: 
    *   **Hardened Meat**: You gain +10 Max HP.
    *   **Deadened Nerves**: You have Advantage on checks to resist Pain or Torture.
    *   **The Price**: You cannot be healed by "Gentle" magic (e.g., standard divine healing spells have no effect). Only "Stitched Medicine" or high-tier "Miracles" work on you.
    *   **Social Stigma**: -10 CHA with "Civilized" folk. +10 Intimidate.

### Combat Actions (AP Costs)
Using Stitched Medicine in the heat of battle is risky and desperate.

*   **Inject Brew (1 AP)**: 
    *   *Target*: Self or Adjacent Ally.
    *   *Effect*: Administer a dose of a Brew (Kickstart, Numb-Juice, etc.).
    *   *Risk*: If you take damage while doing this, make a DEX check or the needle breaks in the target (1d4 dmg + Bleeding).
*   **Field Stitch (2 AP + 1 Zero Cost Action)**: 
    *   *Target*: Adjacent Ally.
    *   *Requirement*: Both you and the target must be stationary (no movement this turn).
    *   *Effect*: Perform a "Field Stitch" to stop **Bleeding** or stabilize a dying ally.
    *   *Check*: Medicine (Routine). On failure, you cause 1d6 damage to the ally.
*   **Emergency Cauterize (1 AP)**: 
    *   *Target*: Self or Adjacent Ally.
    *   *Requirement*: A heat source (Torch, Fire spell, heated blade).
    *   *Effect*: Stops **Bleeding** immediately. Deals 1d10 Fire damage. No check required.

### Treating Specific Injuries (Core Rulebook Integration)
Stitched Medicine offers "Shortcuts" to treating the injuries listed in the Core Rulebook.

| Injury (Core Rulebook) | Standard Treatment (Slow/Safe)  | Stitched Treatment (Fast/Dirty)                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprained Limb**      | Rest (Days).                    | **"Tight-Bind"**: Wrap it so tight circulation cuts off. Ignore penalty for 1 hour, then take 1d6 dmg.             |
| **Deep Gash**          | Bandage & Rest.                 | **"Staple & Glue"**: Close it instantly with staples/resin. Heals 1d10 HP immediately. Scarring permanent.         |
| **Broken Arm/Leg**     | Set Bone & Splint (Weeks).      | **"Plate & Screw"**: Drill metal plates directly into the bone. Usable in 1d4 days. -5 DEX/AGI permanently.        |
| **Severed Finger/Toe** | Cauterize (Permanent Loss).     | **"Beast-Graft"**: Sew on a wolf/goblin digit. Regain function. -2 CHA.                                            |
| **Gouged Eye**         | Clean & Patch (Permanent Loss). | **"Glass & Gear"**: Insert a crude lens. Regain sight (Black & White only). Risk of infection.                     |
| **Internal Bleeding**  | Surgery (Extreme Medicine).     | **"Gut-Pump"**: Cut them open, dump in "Clot-Binder", sew them shut. 50% chance of death, 50% chance of full cure. |

### "Dirty" Hit Points (Temporary Vigor)
Some Brews (like *Kickstart* or *Berserker's Milk*) grant **Temporary HP**.
*   **Rule**: This is not "real" health. It is just the body ignoring damage.
*   **Decay**: When the effect ends, all remaining Temporary HP is lost. If this reduces the character to 0 HP, they fall unconscious and gain a level of **Exhaustion**.

## 8. Surgical Complications Table
*Oops. That wasn't supposed to happen.*

When a Medicine check fails by more than 2 Degrees of Success (DoS), or on a Critical Failure, roll 1d10:

| Roll    | Complication             | Effect                                                                                                                                |
| :------ | :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1-2** | **Nick the Artery**      | The patient begins **Bleeding** (Heavy: 5 dmg/turn). Requires immediate Cauterization.                                                |
| **3-4** | **Nerve Damage**         | Permanent loss of sensation in the area. -5 to **AGI** or **DEX** checks involving that limb.                                         |
| **5-6** | **Tool Left Behind**     | A needle, clamp, or saw tooth is left inside. Patient has chronic pain (-2 to all checks) until removed (another surgery).            |
| **7-8** | **Bad Reaction**         | The patient is allergic to the Brew/Gut used. Takes 3d10 Poison damage and swells up (Stunned for 1 hour).                            |
| **9**   | **Wrong Part**           | (Grafting only) The limb is attached backwards or at a wrong angle. -10 to use.                                                       |
| **10**  | **The Stitcher's Curse** | The wound is haunted by the pain. It never fully closes and weeps black ichor. Advantage on Intimidation, Disadvantage on Persuasion. |
