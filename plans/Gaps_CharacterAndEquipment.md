# Character Creation & Equipment Gaps

## 1. Nature Imbalance
The "Nature" stat arrays are mathematically unbalanced, making some choices strictly superior.
*   **The Lynx** (formerly Rubber Duck): Total Stats **380** (STR 60, AGI 75, INT 60, MND 70, CHA 65, CON 50).
*   **The Wolf** (formerly Balanced): Total Stats **360**.
*   **The Raven** (formerly Brainiac): Total Stats **340** (STR 50, AGI 50, INT 75, MND 60, CHA 65, CON 40).
*   **Issue**: A "The Lynx" has 40 more stat points than a "The Raven".

## 2. Weapon Table Inconsistencies
Several weapons are strictly better than others with similar requirements.
*   **Bastard Sword vs Long Sword**: Both require STR > 50. Bastard Sword deals 6 dmg, Long Sword 5. (Unless Bastard is 2H, but not stated).
*   **Hand Axe vs Meat Axe**: Both require STR > 50. Meat Axe deals 5, Hand Axe 4.
*   **Great Sword vs Two-bladed Sword**: Great Sword (STR>65, Dmg 7) vs Two-bladed (STR>60, Dmg 7). Great Sword has higher req for same damage.

## 3. Armor Rules
*   **Missing Penalties**: The table lists Temp HP, but text implies penalties (e.g., swimming with chainmail). No specific AGI/Skill penalties are listed in the Armor table.
*   **Scaling**: +35 HP (Steel-Ribbed) is massive compared to base HP (~30). This effectively doubles health, making armor mandatory.

## 4. Skill Caps
*   **Ambiguity**: "Skill Max is your base attribute +20".
    *   Example: STR 50. Base Climbing = 25. Max = 70 (50+20).
    *   This allows a +45 point increase. Is this intended?

## 5. Economy
*   **Prices**: A Short Sword costs 3sp. A Cow costs 100sp. A "Mug of Ale" is 1/4 sp.
    *   3sp for a sword seems incredibly cheap (12 ales = 1 sword).
    *   Cow = 33 Swords?
