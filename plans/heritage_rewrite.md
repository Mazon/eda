# Heritage Rewrite Plan (Revised)

## Objective
Rewrite the Heritage descriptions in `Core Rulebook.md` to match a gritty, low-fantasy tone (Conan/Abercrombie). Remove poetic metaphors in favor of grounded, harsh reality. Ensure distinct voices for each. **Crucially, frame these as backgrounds/upbringings, not necessarily current professions.**

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Clansman
*   **Theme:** Tribal loyalty, brutal feuds, survival in the cold.
*   **Upbringing:** You were born where the wind cuts like a knife. Your first lessons were not from books, but from the elders who taught you that the clan is everything and outsiders are nothing.
*   **Draft Description:** *You were born into a world of blood feuds and frozen breath. Your people live in the wild lands, where the law of the King means nothing against the law of the clan. You learned early that survival isn't a right—it's something you fight for every single day. The harsh winds and the constant threat of rival clans have carved you into something harder than stone.*

### 2. Clergy
*   **Theme:** The burden of faith in a godless world.
*   **Upbringing:** You grew up in the shadow of the temple, hearing both the prayers of the faithful and the screams of the damned.
*   **Draft Description:** *You were raised in the presence of the divine, or perhaps just the fear of it. Whether you were an acolyte in a grand cathedral or the apprentice to a village hedge-priest, you saw the desperation in people's eyes when they begged for salvation. You know the weight of silence when the gods do not answer, and you have seen what people will do to keep the darkness at bay.*

### 3. Farmer
*   **Theme:** The crushing weight of nature and poverty.
*   **Upbringing:** Your hands were calloused before you were fully grown. You know the taste of dirt and the fear of a bad harvest.
*   **Draft Description:** *Your childhood was measured in seasons of toil. While others dreamed of glory, you learned the brutal truth of the earth: it takes more than it gives. You spent your youth pulling rocks from the frozen soil and watching the sky for the storm that could starve your family. You know that life is fragile, and that hunger is the only wolf that never sleeps.*

### 4. Artisan
*   **Theme:** Pragmatism and the value of things.
*   **Upbringing:** You grew up in the workshop, surrounded by the smell of hot iron, sawdust, and oil.
*   **Draft Description:** *You were raised among the makers. While the nobles played their games, you learned the value of a well-forged nail and the honesty of a straight edge. You saw how the world is built—piece by piece, with sweat and patience. You learned that everything breaks eventually, and that the one who knows how to fix it will always have a place by the fire.*

### 5. Merchant
*   **Theme:** Survival through wit and greed.
*   **Upbringing:** You learned to count coin before you could read. You watched fortunes made and lost on the turn of a card or a whispered rumor.
*   **Draft Description:** *You grew up on the road or in the bustling markets, where words are weapons and gold is the only shield. You learned early that everyone has a price, and that a sharp mind is more dangerous than a sharp sword. You saw the best and worst of humanity when money was on the table, and you learned to spot a lie before it was even spoken.*

### 6. Noble
*   **Theme:** Faded glory, dangerous pride.
*   **Upbringing:** You were born into a legacy that is slowly crumbling. You were taught to be proud, even as the roof leaked and the silver tarnished.
*   **Draft Description:** *You were born to a name that once commanded armies, but now only commands debts. You were raised in drafty halls filled with the ghosts of past glories, taught to hold your head high even as your family sold off its treasures one by one. You know the burden of expectation, and the bitter taste of pride when there is no gold to back it up.*

### 7. Outcast
*   **Theme:** Living in the cracks of society.
*   **Upbringing:** You were never wanted. You learned to survive in the alleys and the ruins, where the only rule is "don't get caught."
*   **Draft Description:** *You were the child no one wanted, or the one they chased away. You grew up in the shadows of the city or the ruins of the old world, eating scraps and sleeping with one eye open. You learned to be invisible, to see what others ignore, and to survive in places where "decent" folk would perish. Society rejected you, so you learned to live without it.*

## Next Steps
