# Equipment & Talent Scaling Analysis

The current simulation shows a significant difficulty spike in Book 4. Since we are adhering to strict core rules (HP=CON/2), the solution lies in improving the party's **Equipment** and **Talent utility** rather than changing combat mechanics or using artificial multipliers.

## 1. Equipment Gaps
- **Shields:** The current best shield (Metal Shield) provides DR 3. Against endgame bosses doing 35-50 damage, this is negligible. 
- **Armor:** Plate Armor (DR 3) is the ceiling. We need "Relic" tier armor for the endgame.
- **Weapons:** Characters are mostly using standard 9-14 damage weapons. They need magical or high-tier "Sun-Binding" weapons to overcome high boss DR.

## 2. Recommended Relic Additions (For Rulebook)

| Item                        |   Slot    | Effect                             | Lore                       |
| :-------------------------- | :-------: | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| **Aegis of the First King** |  Shield   | DR 5, +10 to Block rolls.          | Found in High Barrow.      |
| **Sun-Forged Plate**        |   Armor   | DR 6.                              | Created in Aethelgard.     |
| **World-Eater's Bane**      |  Weapon   | Damage 25, Ignores 5 DR.           | Needed for Fenrir.         |
| **Star-Iron Cloak**         | Accessory | Resistance to Void/Psychic damage. | Vital for Book 4 survival. |

## 3. Talent Synergy Improvements
- **Strategic AP Spending:** Characters should prioritize **T3 Durable** (+5 Natural Defense) and **T2 Guardian** to protect squishier members.
- **MP Usage:** Mage characters (Seer) need more offensive spells that bypass DR or inflict status effects, as pure physical damage struggles against Nidhogg (DR 10+).

## 4. Next Steps
1.  **Draft Relic Tier:** Create a new section in [`Core Rulebook.md`](Core%20Rulebook.md) for High-Tier/Relic equipment.
2.  **Loot Integration:** Update the Campaign simulation to distribute these relics at the end of Book 2 and Book 3.
3.  **Simulation Re-Run:** Verify if these "natural" rulebook-compliant power spikes bridge the gap.
