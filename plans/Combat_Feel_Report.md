# Combat "Feel" Report: Eda Simulation

This report evaluates the "feel" of combat based on the latest hybrid rules (Core Rulebook + approved proposals).

## 1. Executive Summary
**Overall Feel:** Tactical, Gritty, and High-Stakes.
Combat in Eda feels less like a superhero brawl and more like a desperate skirmish. The "Reaction Economy" is the beating heart of the system, forcing players to make meaningful choices about their survival every single round.

## 2. Core Metrics Evaluation

### A. Is it Smooth? (Flow & Speed)
*   **The Vanguard/Rearguard Flip:** The initiative system is very smooth. Grouping players into two phases eliminates the "waiting for turn #6" slog. Players coordinate within their phase, making it feel like a team effort.
*   **Binary Success:** The "Roll Under" mechanic is the fastest way to resolve actions.
*   **The Friction:** The **Wait** mechanic, while tactical, creates a "mid-round pause" where players have to adjust the turn order. This is a small speed-bump but adds depth.

### B. Cognitive Load (Tracking & Memory)
*   **The Reaction Pool:** This is the highest load. Tracking a finite (but partially refreshing) pool requires constant attention. It’s a "good" load because it creates tension, but it requires a dedicated tracker on the character sheet.
*   **Floating Modifiers:** There are several conditional +10/-10 modifiers (Cover, Movement, Momentum, Talents). Players will need to stay "switched on" to avoid forgetting their bonuses.
*   **Momentum:** Requires a way to remember which buff was chosen after "Waiting."

### C. Tactical Choice (Depth)
*   **High Choice Density:** Almost every turn involves a non-obvious decision:
    *   "Should I act now in Vanguard to kill that wolf, or Wait for Momentum to ensure I hit the boss later?"
    *   "Should I move 3m to get +10 Defense, or stand my ground for a second attack?"
    *   "Do I spend my last Reaction to block this 10-damage hit, or risk it and save the reaction for a potential critical?"
*   **Synergy:** The Setup/Detonator talents (e.g., *Marked for Death* into *Coup de Grace*) feel very rewarding when pulled off.

### D. Dynamics (Movement & Environment)
*   **Moving is the Meta:** Because standing still makes you an easy target (no +10 Def), the battlefield feels dynamic. Characters are constantly repositioning.
*   **The "Charge" Risk:** The Charge action feels appropriately "all-in"—you get the damage bonus but lose your ability to Dodge, which feels terrifying in Eda.

## 3. The "Death Spiral" Feel
The combination of **Low HP** and **Limited Reactions** means that once a character starts losing, they lose fast. 
*   **The Feeling:** It feels "Scary." You are always 1-2 bad rolls away from death.
*   **The Safety Valve:** The proposed **"Second Wind"** and **"Partial Reaction Refresh"** are essential. Without them, the game might feel "Cruel" rather than just "Hard."

## 4. Friction Points & Suggestions

| Friction Point        | Description                                  | Suggested Fix                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Wait AP Cost**      | Spending 1 of 2 AP to Wait is a heavy price. | Consider making "Wait" a **Zero-Cost Action** but you only get Momentum if you actually *did* wait until Rearguard. |
| **Movement Tracking** | "Did I move 3 meters?" is easy to forget.    | Suggest using "Moved" tokens or standardizing 1 AP Move as "The Evasive Move".                                      |
| **Defense Math**      | Success/Failure + DR + Block Value + STR.    | Ensure Character Sheets have a "Total Block Value" pre-calculated.                                                  |

## 5. Final Verdict
**Combat feels like a tactical puzzle where the pieces are your friends' lives.** It is complex enough to reward mastery but easy enough to explain the basics in 5 minutes. The "Feel" is highly evocative of the setting: dark, tactical, and unforgiving.
