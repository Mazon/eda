# Talent Gaps & Issues

## 1. General Rules
*   **Talent Pyramid Contradiction**: The rule "Always need to have more talents of lower level" contradicts the structure (4 T1, 3 T2...).
    *   If I have 1 T2, I need >1 T1 (so 2).
    *   If I have 2 T2, I need >2 T1 (so 3).
    *   If I have 3 T2, I need >3 T1 (so 4).
    *   This enforces a rigid "2-1, 3-2, 4-3" progression, not a "Pyramid" where you can fill the bottom first.

## 2. Common Talents
*   **Focus (T1)**: Spend 1 Action for Advantage on next attack.
    *   *Math Issue*: Attacking twice (2 actions) gives 2 hit chances and 2x damage potential. Advantage (1 action) gives <2x hit chance and 1x damage. It is mathematically inferior to just attacking twice.
*   **Empower (T2)**: Spend 1 Action for +2 Damage.
    *   *Math Issue*: An attack deals ~10 damage. Spending an action for +2 damage is a terrible trade (vs attacking again for +10).
*   **Counter Attack (T3)**: "Negating the incoming damage by 50%".
    *   *Unclear*: Does it deal damage back? Title implies "Attack", description says "Negate".
*   **Duelist (T3)**: "Use your other action as a reaction".
    *   *Unclear*: Does this convert a Main Action to a Reaction? Or give a bonus Reaction? grammar is also broken.
*   **Flurry of Arrows (T2)**: "3 arrows with half damage".
    *   *Clarification*: Is this 3 separate rolls? If so, it triples "on hit" effects (like Overdrive/Crit), making it potentially broken.

## 3. Archetype Talents
*   **Troubadour / Hex Craft Novice (T2)**: No mechanics listed. "Weave curses" - what curses?
*   **Harbinger's Lament (T4)**: "15 psychic damage and stunning".
    *   *Unclear*: Is this auto-hit? AOE? 15 damage is 50% of max HP.
*   **Thug / Brutality (T1)**: "+1 damage".
    *   *Weak*: Compared to "Sneak Attack" (+5) or "Master Crafted" weapons, +1 is negligible.
*   **Zealot / Holy Aura (T2)**: "+5 to defensive rolls".
    *   *Undefined*: There are no "defensive rolls" in the core rules (Defense Actions are automatic). Does this mean Dodge (AGI check)?
*   **Witch / Abyssal Affinity (T3)**: "+50% damage but take 5 damage".
    *   *Math Issue*: Base damage ~10. +50% = +5. You take 5 damage to deal 5 extra damage. This is a net zero trade-off (or negative if you value your HP more).
*   **Witch / Familiar (T3)**: "Gains additional abilities".
    *   *Missing*: What abilities?

## 4. Warden Talents
*   **Vegetation Dependency**: Many talents require "vegetation present".
    *   *Issue*: Makes the class useless in dungeons/cities unless they carry plants?

## 5. Wandering Talents
*   **Teleport (T3)**: "Teleport up to 20 meters... end in shadowed area".
    *   *Unclear*: Action cost? (Assume 1 Action).
