# Final Progression System: "Fail Forward"

This system rewards failure and provides consistent growth, ensuring low skills improve quickly while high skills plateau, all with minimal bookkeeping.

## 1. Skill Improvement (The Fumble Trigger)
*   **Trigger**: You mark a skill for improvement **ONLY** when you roll a **Critical Fumble**.
*   **Definition of Critical Fumble**: Rolling **Doubles** (11, 22, 33...) that are **ABOVE** your Skill Value.
    *   *Example*:
        *   Skill 30. Roll 44. (Fail + Doubles) -> **Fumble**. Mark Skill.
        *   Skill 30. Roll 22. (Success + Doubles) -> **Critical Hit**. No Mark.
        *   Skill 80. Roll 44. (Success + Doubles) -> **Critical Hit**. No Mark.
*   **Why this works**:
    *   **Low Skill (30%)**: Fumbles on 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99. (**7% chance**). Fast growth.
    *   **High Skill (80%)**: Fumbles on 88, 99. (**2% chance**). Slow growth.
*   **Mechanic**: When you Fumble, place a mark next to the skill. At the end of the session, roll `1d100 > Current Skill` to increase it by `1d10`. (Or a simpler fixed increase).

## 2. General Growth (Session XP)
*   **Trigger**: End of every session.
*   **Reward**: All players receive **5 Adventure Points (AP)** (or "Session Points").
*   **Spending AP**:
    *   **Buy Talents**: T1 = 5 AP, T2 = 10 AP, etc.
    *   **Buy Stats**: +1 Stat = 10 AP (Optional rule).
    *   **Train Skills**: Spend AP to improve a skill you *didn't* fumble (for slow, steady training).

## 3. Summary of Benefits
*   **Bookkeeping**: You only track ~1 event per session (the rare Fumble).
*   **Balance**: Weak characters catch up quickly. Strong characters stop snowballing.
*   **Fun**: Turns a "Worst Roll" (Fumble) into a "Best Result" (XP), reducing frustration.
