# Rulebook Analysis & Suggestions

## Heritage

In the core rulebook we have a section on Heritage. What you think about this, is it something we should keep and what could it affect and how could it look to look meaningful and match the tone of the game?

## Combat styles vs skills

The trained skills, max value etc is a bit weird right now. Simplify. 
What skills to get at start, point buy? heritage affect? 


## Talents

Focus is too overpowered
First strike seem too overpowered (maybe if rearguard)

## Cover System

Implemented in Chapter 7. Added Light/Heavy/Full cover, Hunker Down, Suppressing Fire, and Leap for Cover.


## Status


## Blocking

Block seems weak? uses a reaction and only adds DR

Shields are used with the Block reaction. When you successfully block, you add the shield's DR to your
armor's DR for that attac


## Cleanup

General Equipment and speciality items need to move down.
Move: Up to Speed (DEX / 2?). , should be AGI / 2


## Pushed rolls
Remove them?

## Dodge

Success: You move out of the way and take 0 Damage
Should be half damage on success to not be overpowered.


## Movement
Find ways to increase the movement in combat. Cover could indirectly be such a way since people want to find cover but look into other way to make it interesting to move around on the combat field so it not just becomes "i hit you, you hit me"


## fumble

remove improvement roll

"The Improvement Roll: At the end of the session, for each marked skill, roll 1d100. If the result is
GREATER than your current skill value, the skill increases by 1d10 points. If it is lower, it increases by
1 point"

just increase with 1 point for each fumble directly when you fumble. Feels best and no need to track.
