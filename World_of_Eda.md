## Part I: The GM Toolkit

### 1. Environmental Mechanics

#### Weather & The Long Winter
In the current era, weather is not just background—it is a survival mechanic. The Long Winter (The Wolf-Age) has made the environment hostile.

**Rolling for Weather (d100)**
Roll once per day (or once per travel segment).

| d100 | Condition | Description | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01-30 | **Still Cold** | Eerily quiet, freezing air. | No immediate hazard, but visibility is high. |
| 31-60 | **Falling Snow** | Constant, light snowfall. | -1 DoS to Tracking and Ranged Combat. |
| 61-80 | **The Howling Gale** | Strong winds and heavy snow. | Routine (1 DoS) Fitness check or gain 1 Fatigue. |
| 81-95 | **Whiteout** | Blindness-inducing blizzard. | Visibility 0. Movement requires Hard (4 DoS) Navigation. |
| 96-00 | **Old Night Chill** | Supernatural cold that saps the soul. | Routine (1 DoS) Willpower check or lose 1 HP (ignores armor). |

#### Travel & Survival
Eda is a world where distance is measured in danger, not miles.

**Travel Segments**
A day is divided into three segments: Morning, Afternoon, and Night. 
*   **Normal Pace**: 1 segment of travel (Morning or Afternoon).
*   **Forced March**: 2 segments of travel. Requires a Routine (1 DoS) Fitness check to avoid Fatigue.
*   **Night Travel**: Requires light sources. Disadvantage on all Perception checks.

**Fatigue**
Fatigue represents physical and mental exhaustion.
*   **Level 1**: -1 DoS to all physical checks.
*   **Level 2**: -2 DoS to all physical checks; movement speed halved.
*   **Level 3**: Incapacitated until a Long Rest is completed.

## Part II: Lore of the World

### 1. The Secrets of Eda
*   **The Name**: Eda does mean "Wondrous," but it was a name given to the world by the Old Night before it was imprisoned. To speak the name is to acknowledge the world's original owner.
*   **The Old Night**: It is not a shadow, but a lack of existence. It wants to return the world to the "Golden Void" where nothing changed and nothing died because nothing lived.

### 2. Religions & Cults
*   **The Ashen Seers**: They believe the Long Winter is a cleansing fire of frost. They seek to "purify" the weak by leaving them in the cold.
*   **The Church of the Sun-Bringer**: Mostly dead, but some still light candles to King Haldor. They are seen as heretics by the Iron Covenant.
*   **The Quiet ones**: A secret society that believes the "Hollowed" are the next stage of evolution—a life without the pain of cold or hunger.

### 3. The Nature of Demons (Demoner)
Demoner (Dæmons, Fell, Urgudar) is a collective term for entities so horrific, unique, and powerful that they defy traditional classification. They are not a single race, but a variety of singular terrors.

*   **Origins**: Unknown. Theories range from fallen angels to extraterrestrial entities or beings risen from the black hole at the center of the galaxy.
*   **Influence**:
    *   **Lesser Demons**: Often seize control of human or animal bodies (see Possessed Creatures) to satisfy twisted passions or minor evil ends.
    *   **Higher Demons**: Work through those in power, exchanging forbidden knowledge and power for lives and souls.
*   **The Great Names**: Ancient and powerful entities often confused with gods by half-mad mages. They include names such as Dagon, Hydra, Shub Nigurath, Yog Sothoth, and Lilith. Contacting them almost invariably leads to madness.

### 4. Magic & The Occult

In the world of Eda, magic is an all-permeating force, both admired and feared. The study of the occult often leaves deep scars on the body, pride, and mind. True mastery requires sacrifice—either of one's own soul or through the ritual transfer of damage to others.

#### Elements of Power
*   **The Power of Urine**: Used to cleanse magical symbols or provide guidance. It can also be used as a base for hallucinogenic brews when combined with toxic plants like wolfsbane or mandrake.
*   **Spit**: A simple but common way to ward off minor evil or entangle low-level curses.
*   **Skulls & Bones**: Human remains are the most potent. They serve as guardians, hide one from the gaze of enemies, or provide protection in combat (e.g., finger bones knotted into hair to ward off stabs).
*   **Human Skin & Blood**: Painting equipment with human blood makes it exceptionally lethal. A "Death Mask"—the skin of a sacrificed person—is one of the most powerful artifacts a sorcerer can possess.
*   **Vital Fluids**: Semen and menstrual blood are used in potent love charms or to bind others into service.
*   **Sex Magic**: The "Little Death" of climax provides a momentary glimpse of the immortal soul, allowing for the invocation of powerful spirits, the binding of demons, or the opening of portals.

### 5. The Influence of Time
In Eda, time is not merely a measure of duration, but a cycle of mystical shifts. There are moments when the boundaries between worlds blur, and the magic of the Old Night or the hidden realms of the Fairies bleeds into the world of the living.

#### The Cycle of the Day
The transition between light and dark is more than a natural phenomenon; it is a spiritual shift in the world's fabric.

*   **Dawn (The Awakening)**: As the world awakens, spirits retreat to the shadows. It is said that benevolent magic is most effective during this time, and the gateway to the Fairy world is momentarily ajar.
*   **Twilight (The Slumber)**: As the world falls asleep, the spirits wake up. Witches and sorcerers often perform their more destructive rites at dusk, as the veil between worlds thins.
*   **Night (The Forbidden)**: The deepest, most forbidden magics are performed on black, moonless nights. Tales speak of supernatural surges during storms or when a Yellow or Red moon hangs in the sky, making magic both more potent and far more unpredictable.
*   **Fog (The Blurred Realm)**: When the fog rolls in, the living are advised to stay indoors. You never know what hides within the mist, nor where you might end up if you wander too deep into the "Between."

#### The Great Feasts
The people of Eda observe four major festivities that mark the turning of the year.

*   **New Year (Post-Midwinter)**: A grand celebration to bid farewell to the old and welcome the new. 
    *   **The Omen**: Clergy spend hours deciphering signs. If the weather is beautiful, it foretells a year of plenty. If the weather is foul, a year of hardship awaits.
*   **Equinox (Tribute to Spring)**: A celebration of the sun's return. Fires are lit, and the people dance.
    *   **The Sacred Harvest**: To ensure a good harvest, the nobility (or a priest/priestess) should sleep with a partner in a sacred grove or field. 
    *   **Special Births**: Children conceived on this night are considered to have a "Great Fate" ahead of them.
*   **Midsummer (The Blessed Birth)**: A crucial time where the veil is thin.
    *   **The Flower Dream**: Placing different flowers under a pillow allows one to dream of their future spouse.
    *   **The Protection**: Children born on this day are blessed but must be fiercely protected; they are coveted by trolls and fairies who seek to swap them for changelings.
*   **Harvest Festival (The Soul's Joy)**: Celebrated on the evening the last harvest is gathered. 
    *   **Sacrifice**: Offerings are made to the gods, followed by two days of revelry.
    *   **Fate**: Children conceived or born during this festival are destined for a fortunate life.
*   **Midwinter Night (The Driving of the Dead)**: A night of noise, music, and love to remind the dead they do not belong among the living.
    *   **Driving Away Wraiths**: Wraiths walk the earth this night. Households use loud alarms and "warding liquids" (like urine) outside doors to keep them at bay.
    *   **The Unlucky**: Children born on this night are considered cursed or inherently evil. This fate can only be averted if a *Jungfru* (Pure One) lifts the child from the womb, a rare and difficult task.

### 6. Iron Signs & Omens
Magic practitioners often observe "Iron Signs" to gauge the flow of fate. There are thousands of iron signs and there are thousands of ways to interpret them. Farmers have their ways and lords have theirs. But only the properly educated and knowledgeable priests and magicians know how the characters should be interpreted properly. One thing, however, is certain: iron signs and omens are extremely important. That's how the gods speak to the people. While many believe these signs influence their luck, they are primarily seen as messages to be decoded rather than fixed rules of nature.

Some practitioners utilize **Sacrificial Omens**—specific acts, such as the *Lamb's Sacrifice* or *Nail Burning*, intended to appease the spirits or the gods to ensure a desired outcome.

#### Good Omens
*   **The Victorious Bird**: If a buzzard, eagle, falcon, hawk, or raven fights with a snake, it is a good omen if the bird wins.
*   **The Faithful Hound**: A dog sitting at the door of a cabin is a sign of protection and luck.
*   **Nature's Clock**: When ash trees turn green before the oaks, it foretells a dry, manageable summer.
*   **Dusk Wings**: Seeing bats flying at dusk is a sign of a peaceful transition.
*   **The Red Guest**: A robin flying into the house brings news of warmth.
*   **The White Wing**: A white butterfly or a butterfly within the house is a blessing on the hearth.
*   **Four-Leaf Clover**: Finding one is a rare stroke of luck.
*   **Hearth Singers**: Hearing crickets play is a blessing; they must never be disturbed.
*   **Nail Burning**: Burning your cropped nails prevents them from being used in dark magic.
*   **The Sky's Gift**: Walking in the rain or carrying a rain-stone.
*   **White Flora**: Seeing a white Ljungkvist.
*   **Small Blessings**: A ladybug or a blue thrush.
*   **The Pair**: Two white horses in pairs.
*   **The Dark Procession**: Watching three black cats walk in a row.
*   **The Golden Gift**: Getting a beehive as a gift.
*   **Acorn Fall**: Being hit by a falling acorn.
*   **Threshold Cow**: Seeing a cow outside the door means good health to everyone in the yard.
*   **The Important Guest**: A grasshopper in the house means a friend or important person will arrive.
*   **The Coming Swine**: A pig coming towards you is good luck. (But if it turns around, happiness escapes).
*   **Celestial Union**: Getting married during a full moon or in bright sunshine.
*   **The Red Weaver**: A little red spider on your clothes. Do not interfere with its work.
*   **Falling Stars**: A wish made upon a falling star can be fulfilled.
*   **Nightingale's Song**: To hear the nightingale is to hear the gods' favor.
*   **The Magpie Count**:
    *   **Two Magpies**: Crossing your path means good luck.
    *   **Three Magpies**: Crossing your path means a marriage is coming.
    *   **Four Magpies**: Crossing your path means a childbirth.
*   **The Lamb's Sacrifice**: A newborn lamb buried alive or its skin nailed to a tree ensures a plentiful flock the following year.
*   **Midsummer Dreams**: If an unmarried man picks seven or nine kinds of flowers on Midsummer's Eve and puts them under his pillow, he will dream of his future.
*   **Salt & Soil**: Throwing salt or soil over your shoulder scares off bad luck.
* **The Iron Bite**: Biting into a piece of iron when danger threatens grants protection.
* **Omens of the Gut**: Freshly harvested entrails used for lithomancy—the art of reading the future in the spill of blood and organs.

#### Bad Omens
*   **The Accursed Birth**: Traditionally, children born with severe disabilities are seen as carrying inherent evil and are often "returned to the earth" in the forest.
*   **The Defiled Birth**: Disabled children are born with evil in themselves; traditionally, they are "returned to the earth" in the forest or drowned.
*   **Five-Leaf Clover**: Unlike its four-leafed cousin, a five-leaf clover is a sign of unnatural growth and ill fortune.
*   **The Accursed Number**: The number 13 is inherently tied to the Old Night.
*   **The Sneeze**: A sneeze means an enemy is speaking your name. Saying "prosit" can scare off the bad luck.
    *   **The Traveler's Sneeze**: Sneezing when about to leave for a journey is a dire warning. Stopping for a few seconds can reset the luck.
*   **Spilled Salt**: Spilling salt is an invitation to misfortune.
*   **Storm-Blood**: Cutting yourself during a storm is a sign the elements are hostile to you.
*   **The Broken Link**: If a chain breaks while you are wearing it, it signifies the end of a deep relationship.
*   **Wall-Tappers**: Hearing small insects against the wall of a house foretells death or heavy misfortune.
*   **The Fallen Banner**: If a lord's banner falls to the ground, his rule or life is in danger.
*   **Crossed Blades**: Two knives crossed after falling to the ground mean times of unrest or the approach of enemies.
*   **The Owl's Cry**: An owl hooting is a sign of impending doom.
*   **The First Cuckoo**: Being the first to hear the cuckoo's call in spring is a heavy burden of bad luck.
*   **The Treacherous Rat**: A rat crossing your path signifies a treacherous servant or ally.
*   **The Serpent's Path**: A snake crossing your path represents evil, enemies, and treason. It must be killed to break the omen.
*   **The Raven's Shadow**: Seeing a raven or hearing it sing means evil times are coming soon.
*   **The Howl**: To hear wolves howl signifies that evil is approaching.
*   **The Defeated Bird**: If a snake kills a bird of prey in a fight, it is a sign that the ground will swallow the sky.

### 7. Oaths & Curses

In Eda, an oath is not merely a promise; it is a spiritual anchor that binds the soul to a word. To break an oath is to tear that anchor loose, leaving the spirit to drift in the frozen void of the Old Night. In a feudal society where trust is the only currency that doesn't rust, an oath-breaker is the lowest form of existence.

#### The Weight of the Word
*   **Everlasting Contempt**: He who has once broken an oath draws the contempt of all for all time. Legends speak of the "Stain of the Wordless," a spiritual mark that even the uninitiated can sense.
*   **The Broken Trust**: No one can trust an oath-breaker. Their word means nothing, and they are barred from all business, trade, and legal protection. In many settlements, an oath-breaker is treated as a ghost—unseen and unheard.
*   **The Severed Body**: When an oath-breaker dies, they are denied a proper burial. They are put into the ground like carrion, their head separated from the body and laid between their legs to ensure they cannot find their way back.
*   **The Wraith's Path**: Considered cursed by the gods, an oath-breaker has no place in the afterlife. They are destined to wander the world as a wraith, trapped between the warmth of life and the peace of death.
*   **Family Burden**: The curse of the oath-breaker extends to their kin. Only if the family publicly dissociates itself from the sworn-in can their reputation—and their souls—be spared the stain.

#### The Divine Mandate
*   **The Sovereign's Voice**: Sworn oaths can only be set aside by a king or a queen. They are the only mortals with the divine right to forgive an oath-breaker and cleanse the stain.
*   **Pitted Oaths**: If two oaths are pitted against each other, the "Oldest Oath" (the one first sworn) is considered most important. The sworn man must ask the holder of the second oath for permission to break it, or at least delay its fulfillment, to honor the first.

#### Curses
In Eda, anyone can cast a curse, but their strength depends on the caller. Curses cast by kings, grieving parents, or the dying are particularly feared. The timing also matters; a curse uttered on a moonless night or during a holy feast carries far more weight.

## Part III: The Gazetteer

### 1. Factions & Societies

The following organizations operate in the shadows of Eda, each pursuing their own mysterious agendas.

*   **Curatores Lucis (Guardians of Light)**: Founded during the final days of the Inquisition, they have sworn to protect humanity from the supernatural. They operate from a massive library in London and recruit those who have survived paranormal encounters.
*   **Vitae Ordo (The Order of Life)**: A secretive group seeking immortality. Founded by Konrad Kamper, the order is infamous for its elitism and its practice of sacrificing blood relatives to maintain the eternal life of its inner circle.
*   **Domini Voraginis (Lords of the Abyss)**: A splinter group from the Vitae Ordo, they embrace darkness openly. Unlike the Ordo, they do not care about heritage, often collaborating with mages and witch doctors from across the globe.
*   **Sorores (The Sisters)**: An all-female order of mages who believe the ultimate power lies in femininity. They use "Glamour" magic to maintain preternatural beauty and believe men were created to serve and protect them.
*   **Societas Luxus (Society of Lust)**: Founded during the plague years, they believe that passion and pleasure are the only escapes from a cruel world. Their rituals are legendary for their intensity but they strictly forbid harming others.

## Part IV: The Gazetteer

### 1. The Fjordlands (Current Focus)
*   **Oakhaven**: The last "green" city, kept warm by geothermal vents that are slowly failing.
*   **The High Barrow**: The prison of the Old Night. It is cracking.
*   **The Iron Hold**: A fortress carved into a mountain of iron. It is impenetrable but relies entirely on stolen food from the plains.

### 2. The Whispering Woods (To be expanded)
*   A forest where the trees are turned to black glass.
*   Home to the "Glass-Singers," spirits that mimic the voices of lost loved ones.
