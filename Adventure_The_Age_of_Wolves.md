# Part I: The Gazetteer of the North

## History of the Fjordlands

### The Age of Heroes
Three hundred years ago, the Fjordlands were green. King Haldor the Sun-Bringer united the clans under one banner, driving the trolls back into the deep earth. It was a time of plenty, where the summers were long and the harvests golden. Haldor built the High Barrow as a vault, not for treasure, but to imprison the "Old Night"—an ancient force he defeated but could not kill.

### The Betrayal
Legend says Haldor’s own son, Skoll, sought to harness the Old Night. He opened the vault, and though he was struck down, a crack was formed. A slow leak of shadow. The green faded. The winters grew longer.

### The Long Winter
Three years ago, the sun stopped rising fully. It skirts the horizon, a pale, heatless disc. The snow never melts. Crops have failed. Livestock is freezing. The "Wolf-Age" whispered of in prophecy has arrived. Civilization has collapsed into three desperate states: The Tyranny of the Strong (Iron Covenant), The Madness of the Faithful (Ashen Seers), and the Silence of the Dead (The Hollowed).

## Geography & Regions

### 1. The White Plains
The vast, open tundra that dominates the central Fjordlands.

*   **Terrain:** Flat, wind-scoured ice fields. Visibility is often poor due to blowing snow.
*   **Inhabitants:** Herds of Caribou (dwindling), packs of Dire Wolves, and the Nomadic Clans who refuse to bow to Hrothgar.
*   **Hazards:** *Whiteouts* (Visibility 0), *Razor-Ice* (sharp shards hidden in snow), *The Wind-Walkers* (spirits that steal warmth).

### 2. The Iron Peaks
The jagged mountain range to the North and East.

*   **Terrain:** Impossibly steep granite cliffs, frozen waterfalls, and deep mining tunnels.
*   **Key Location:** **The Iron Hold**, Hrothgar's fortress, sits at the base of the highest peak.
*   **Secrets:** The deep mines have broken into ancient caverns where "The Hollowed" originate.

### 3. The Weeping Woods
A dense pine forest to the West.

*   **Atmosphere:** The trees drip with a sap that looks like tears. Sounds are muffled.
*   **Lore:** It is said the woods are the domain of the "Old Gods"—spirits of nature who are angry at humanity.
*   **Danger:** Do not light a fire here without offering a prayer, or the trees themselves may attack.

### 4. The Black Coast
The northern shoreline where the land meets the Frozen Sea.

*   **Visual:** Black sand beaches, icebergs the size of castles, and the skeletons of whales.
*   **Inhabitants:** **Drowners** wash up here in droves. Smugglers use the hidden coves to transport goods (and people) between the settlements.

## Factions & Politics

### The Iron Covenant

*   **Leader:** Jarl Hrothgar "The Butcher".
*   **Motto:** "Iron Endures."
*   **Philosophy:** The weak endanger the herd. To survive the Winter, we must be hard. Food is rationed by usefulness. The sick are exiled.
*   **Military:**
    *   *Ironguards:* Heavy infantry in plate mail.
    *   *Wolf-Brothers:* Berserkers who wear wolf pelts and use stimulants.
    *   *The Forgemasters:* Engineers who build siege engines and craft weapons.

### The Ashen Seers

*   **Leader:** Mother Valka.
*   **Motto:** "Fire Purifies."
*   **Philosophy:** The Winter is a punishment for the sin of Magic. Only by burning the "Unclean" (witches, magical creatures, artifacts) can we bring back the Sun.
*   **Practices:** They wear blindfolds to "see the truth." They wield maces heated in braziers. They control **Pyre-Watch**, a city lit by eternal bonfires.

### The Forgotten Clans

*   **Leader:** Disparate Chieftains.
*   **Motto:** "The Old Ways Remember."
*   **Philosophy:** Survival through harmony with nature. They reject both Hrothgar's tyranny and Valka's fanaticism.
*   **Status:** Hunted by both sides. They hide in the Weeping Woods and the deep caves.

# Part III: The Adventure

## Act I: The Bleeding Land
**Theme:** Survival, Exposure, Isolation.

### Introduction: The Iron Cage
The characters begin as prisoners of the **Iron Covenant**. They have been stripped of their gear, their titles, and their dignity.

> **Read Aloud:**
> Consciousness returns slowly, accompanied by the rhythm of rattling wheels and the smell of unwashed bodies. You are crammed into a rusted iron cage on the back of a wagon. The biting cold (-15°C) slips through the bars, stinging your skin. Outside, the world is a blur of grey snow and black pine trees passing by. You have no weapons, no armor, and no memory of how many days you’ve been traveling. You only know hunger.

**The Prisoners:**

*   **Old Kael:** A one-eyed elder with frostbitten, black fingers. He huddles in the corner, rocking back and forth. "Don't you smell it? Copper and rot. The woods are bleeding."
*   **Bruna:** A fierce shield-maiden, her face bruised and lip split. She tests the bars constantly. "Save your breath, old man. When these bars break, Hrothgar’s men die first."

### Scene 1: The Crash
Suddenly, the horses stop screaming. Silence falls—heavy and unnatural. Then a **roar** vibrates through the floorboards, shaking your very bones.

> **Read Aloud:**
> The wagon flies sideways. You are thrown against the iron bars, the impact knocking the wind out of you. Metal screeches against stone as the world spins. The cage rolls—once, twice—and slams into a frozen creek bed. Ice water, shock-cold, floods the floor. The door hinges snap with a loud *CRACK*. You are free, but you are freezing.

**Mechanic: The Crash**

*   All players must make a **CON Check (Routine - 1 DoS)**.
*   **Failure:** Take **5 Bludgeoning damage** and start with **1 Level of Exhaustion**.

**The Horror:**
Looking up at the road (50ft up the embankment), they see a **Dire Bear** standing on two legs. Its fur is matted with black slime. It tears a guard in half like wet paper. It doesn't see them... yet.

### Scene 2: Scavenging & Survival

*   2 **Wool Cloaks** (Heavy, rough wool).

#### Survival Rules Sidebar
> **The Cold:** Without proper clothing (Cloaks/Furs), a character must make a **CON Check** every hour of exposure.
> *   **Failure:** Gain **1 level of Exhaustion**.
> *   **Exhaustion**: See Core Rulebook for effects.
