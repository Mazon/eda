Eda
===

# Preface

Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. Jonah walked to get water for dinner in the river behind the house. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the piano. Jonah bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.

Eda is a dark fantasy game. while still having magic, wonders and amazing adventure. Magic and supernatural things usually have higher consequence for everyone involved compared to many other games in this genre.

# The World

Eda is name of the world. Living in Eda can be though and deadly. It was not always this way, once an upon a time the stories tell about a prosperous land where most people lived in peace and harmony. The name Eda itself is said to have mean “Wonderous” in an ancient language long forgotten. Nowadays not many still believe in the legends, and they are mostly whispered quietly over a drink in a dimly lit tavern or hiding in their home. Common people are not only scared of darkness, monsters and other creatures roaming the country side but also by religious fanatics, different groups of powerful clans and type of government. Most of the ones that rule are bandits, scoundrels and man trying to pray on the weaker. Then there is diseases, harsh weather, pests eating the crops. No, life is not easy for the one trying to do good.

# Introduction

A tabletop role playing game that is played with a group of friends. One acts as a Game Master. GM for short. The rest will take control of a character they make. The players will act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide the players in the game but it is a collaborative adventure and the GM many times reacts to what players want. The primary goal of the game is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance only and your group might feel like changing some aspects that makes it more fun. The game is divided into adventures and campaigns. Where the players will go thru a series of adventures, level up and becomes stronger. A series of adventures connected together by a continuing story line is called a campaign.

# Playing the game

## Game Sessions

Is freely up to the group to decide how long to play, but a general tip is to keep the sessions around 4 hours and no longer then 6 hours. This will give you a good amount of time to get into the story but stop before everyone is too exhausted. Try plan your time ahead of time so everyone knows when the game will start and around what time the game will end. 

## Session 0

It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure but only make sure everyone have a character created, that backstories are done and you are fully ready. Set expectations and discuss with the players how you would like the tone of the game to be.

## Dice

Dice is used to decide outcomes of things that might go one way or the other. The dice used is two ten sided dice to represent a value between 1-100. The lowest a dice roll can be is 01 and the highest is two 00 that represent 100. One dice is used to represent the ten digits and is called the primary dice, the other dice is called secondary dice and is used to represent 0-9. 

```
Tip: to have 2 more D10 dice to use as indicators for how many temporary hit points the character have availble.
```

### Division

There are cases when you need to divide by 2 etc to get new values for skills etc. In all these cases we round down. Example: 75 / 2 equals 37.

### Checks

Everything your character can perform and test against have a value between 01 and 100. Such as skills, combat abilities and magic. Every time you need to roll the dice, the aim is to roll under a target value but as high as possible. If roll over that target, it is a failure.

```
Success

Jonah has 70 in swimming and falls in a river with a normal strong current. Jonah says he tries to swim to shore. GM asks for a dice roll on Jonah’s swimming skill. Jonah rolls 48 and succeeds.

Failure

Jonah rolls 85 and since he only has 70 in swimming, he fails and GM says he is unable to swim to shore and start drifting downstream towards the giant waterfall, barely keeping his face and mouth above water.
```

### Competing Checks

Sometimes There are competing rolls with someone. Example if you would arm wrestle with someone. The GM would maybe ask for a strength roll by you and the person you arm wrestle against.

```
You have a strength of 50 and the person you wrestle against has a strength of 80. You roll 43, 4 successes. The person you wrestle against rolls a 25, 2 success and you win. Since he has a higher skill level, he does have a higher chance of winning but can fail. If one person doesn't succeed at all, then the other person wins. If both fail, it is a draw.
```

### Degree of Success

Even if you succeed with a check you also perform things with different degrees of success. A way to measure how good something happened and many times it is not enough to just succeed, you will need to succeed better then normal to have better results. 

#### Difficulty Modifier

|Difficulty | Modifier
|-----------|----------
| Easy      | N/A
| Normal    | 0
| Challenge | 1 success
| Hard      | 2 success
| Near Impossible | 3 success


```
Jonah has 70 in swimming and falls into the river and the current in the river is very strong. Jonah is trying to swim to shore and the GM asks for a skill check in swiming. Jonah rolls 28 and succeeds. This is 2 degrees of success counting the primary dice. However since the current is very strong, 3 degrees of success was needed and Jonah failed but he was close so the GM might say he did not reach the shore and keep tumbling down the river but he able to catch a wooden branch, allowing him some rest and to try again.
```

### Critical rolls

You can roll critical, which means you success is automatic and exceptional.
Same on both dice if you are under your skill value is always a critical hit and will create a special effect. E.g 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99 and 00. 

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes effects can give advantages or disadvantages. You do this by using any of the two d10 as main dice. Recording the best result. While if you roll with disadvantage you record the worst result.
Example
Jonah had a chain mail when he fell in the river so GM says he will need to roll his swimming skill with disadvantage because the armor is heavy and dragging him down. Jonah rolls 43 on the first but 85 on the second time and fails.


### Pushed Rolls

You can try an action again if you can rationale in-game why you should be able to test this again to the game master. If you fail a pushed roll the failure is likely to be more severe then the first time. You can only do one pushed roll per long rest.

# Making a character

To create a character you make different choices that customize the character to feel interesting and fun. Some people love to min/max and think about how they can make the strongest character possible while others just want to create something that will be fun to role play. The choice is yours.

A character consists of the following areas described in separate paragraphs:
Ability Scores, Genome, Skills, Talents, Points, Course of life, Magic, Equipment and Journal.

Don’t worry, while it sounds a lot. It is quite easy to create a character. This chapter tries to lay out an order that is logical and make it as easy as possible but feel free to jump between sections and do it in whatever order you want. During character creation you will record score values on different things, while trying to make it as simple as possible. Some values will be altered by the next step in the process. So be ready with an eraser! A sample character is also included in the appendix with the character sheet template.

A good idea is to first have a look at the genome and talent table sections to get some inspiration and an idea of what type of character you would like to create or maybe you already know. When you feel ready and have an empty character sheet in front of you. Let's get started!

## Quickstart

1. Select your genome
2. Calculate your skills
3. Buy initial talents
4. Calculate your resource points
5. Buy equipment.
6. Write about who the character is.

# Ability Scores

Determines your raw abilities such as your strength or intelligence. They affect baselines in skills and are used in dice rolls. There are 6 different ability scores.

| Ability | Description 
|---------|------------
|Strength (STR) | Represents your raw power, and inherent strength inside. Needed to carry heavy armor and weapons.
| Agility (AGI) | Nimbleness, flexibility, how good your aim is. How good your mind and body are in sync with each other.
| Intelligence (INT) | Thought, reflection and memory. Can you recall an old fact long forgotten by most. Deduction and understanding languages or figure out a puzzle.
|  Charisma (CHA) | Are you always in the center of attention and people listen to what you say, do you get the best prizes or even free things at the market? Chances are you have a high charisma.
| Mind (MND) | Things that are outside the conscious intelligence, focus and concentration. Determination and will. Can you sense things that others cannot. Can you focus so hard on nature, so nature focuses back on you?
| Constitution (CON) | Determination of the body, survival instinct. For how long can you walk? Be without food and water. 

# Genome

Your genetics determine your raw power. What you are good at. It does not mean you need to follow that path rigorously and you have taken many other choices in life that guide who you are but you are likely to be better at things your genetics have decided. Select one genome to get your base ability scores.

# Skills

Skills are used in skill checks to see if you can perform certain tasks and are usually more broad in nature. E.g one skill could be used to perform multiple tasks within that area. The GM will usually ask for a specific skill check.
Each skill has a skill score associated with them that is used when checking for the skill.

```
Example Skill: Forgery, you are able to create different types of forgeries, or possibly detect a forgery.
```

At character creation you take the attribute associated with each and every skill and divide it by 2. That is your skill score without any training in them. Representing that most people have some non zero chance of success in most things. To increase skills further, you will need to spend points in them.

Skill max is your base attribute +20. 


```
Example. You have 50 in STR, you cannot increase your climbing more than to 70. To represent that with training you can extend yourself but there are still limits based from your raw genetic power.
```

# Talents

Talents represent more specific things you can do compared to skills. It can also be an ability that you possess. There are different categories of talents such as combat talents, common talents etc. 
You will be able to pick these as specified in the experience and progression section.

## Talent Pyramid

A character can have 
four tier 1 talents,
three tier 2 talents,
two tier 3 talents and one tier 1 talent. 

Always need to have more talents of lower level before getting one of higher level. So example need to have two tier 1 talents before getting one tier 2 talent. 

Talents come into different archetype categories and one common category. A character can select a talent from any category he want as long as the talent don’t say it have some other requirement. Example could be a talent saying it need 3 witch talents. That would mean cannot buy this talent before that requirement is fullfilled. 

| Tier | Cost (xp)
| ----|----
| T1 | 5
| T2 | 10
| T3 | 15
| T4 | 20

You start your character with two free tier 1 talents that you can select. Write them down in the top tier 1 row.

# Resources

Resources are recalculated if ability scores changes. 

## Dodge

`Dex / 4` is characters base line dodge chance. During a attack. If the roll is successful but under the opponents dodge chance. Then damage will be halfed, representing that while not avoiding the hit fully, some avoidance is done. Like moving out of the critical strike zone.

Only one avoidance bonus can be used, example if in cover at the same time, the highest value will be the one used. 


```
Jonah have 60 DEX, his dodge chance will be 15. ( 60 / 4 )
```

## Speed

Take your `DEX / 2` to get your speed points that determine how far you can move with one action.


```
Jonah have 60 DEX, his speed will be 30 meters.
```


## Health Points

You `CON / 2` is your health points. Usually a value around 25-35
If a character falls to 0 health points he falls into death. 


```
Jonah have 50 CON, his health points will be 25.
```

## Defense Points

These are points that are deducted first before removing from health points. There are many things that can give defense points such as armor, blocks, parry or magical defenses.


```
Jonah have a leather armor and also uses a small round shield to block a attack with his reaction. Leather armor adds 10 temp health points, and block value of a small round shield is 2. So Jonah have 12 defense points. 
``` 

## Mind Points

Each player have mind points­ they can use. Usually these are consumed by talents, magic etc. You have mind points equal to your `MND  / 4`.  

```
You have MND 60, you have 15 mind points to spend. You recover your mind points on a long rest.
```


# Magic

Magic is rare and dangerous activity. Drawing power from humankind despair and sorrow. To use magic the player will need to have the specific talent such as hex craft or rituals. Also would need to know the specific spell and to perform the spell the player will need to create a sentence and/or gestures that activate the spell during gameplay. A players Mind ability affects the efficiency and how much magic can be used.

If you selected a magic related talent during character creation, you are free to get one novice spell for free.
Course of life
Describe your character as well as you can. Are you a generous and good person, do you like any animals? What are your goals in life? It doesn't have to be pages and pages of information and your character will grow over time but take a moment to think what kind of person this is when we meet him/her.

# Equipment

You will start out with a few items but during your travels in the world you will fill your pockets with many useful things. You start with 30 silver pieces. You can spend these freely in the item appendix and record on your character before you start.

# Journal

Your journal is whatever you want it to be, notes taken during adventuring. Friends you found, friends you lost. Allies, organizations you are part of. Anything around your character you keep to remember..


# Adventuring

## Downtime

If there is a long downtime, depending on if the characters plausible would have access to shops etc. You are allowed to spend coins on anything that would plausible be available. It is also okey to perform other type of normal duties such as bathing or go to the barber etc.
Rest & Recovery
Normal Rest
8 hours of sleep. Small interruption of sleep can be included as long no excessive physical extrusion. 
You recover 4 hp per day if sleeping normally.

## Health & Injuries

Healing abilities

Using aid skill and bandage or splint a broken arm can stop bleeding and an injury from getting worse.


## Injuries

Severely injured
If less then 5 hp after taking damage, the character is severely injured and don’t have any avoidance and might suffer many other effects. 

# Encounters

A combat encounter is divided into turns and rounds. Each round has each of the combatants use actions on their turn starting in initiative order.

## Initiative

All the player characters make a normal AGI check, and those that pass go before the opponents in a group turn, then the opponents get a group turn, then the player character that failed initiative get a group turn. After that it’s a new round and the player characters make their initiative check again.

## Rounds & Turn

Each combatant gets two action points and use of one zero cost action on their turn.
When every combatant is done with their turn a new round starts.

## Actions

The things that can be done using action points.

| action | description |
| -------|-------------
| Move   | can move up to speed DEX / 2 meters.
| Use Talent | use active talents and implement the effect.
| Use Skill |  use any skill such as  weapon skills.
| Help | Lending your help to an ally, giving advantage on an action. Need to be within melee range. 
| Activate / Manipulate Item | Can example open a door, light a candle or smaller simpler tasks that take some time.
| Draw and Sheathe a weapon | To change your weapon, example to switch from your bow to a sword you will need to use a action.
| Mount / Dismount | To mount or dismount animals or a vehicle 
| Stand up | To get up if sitting or prone. 
| Prepare | You can save one action to become a reaction, used at any point in the round


## Zero cost action

There are some things that you can do for free during your turn, and should be short simple things like speaking short sentences or closing a door ( but not locking it ). The GM has freedom here to allow or deny something depending on the situation.


## Misc encounter rules

Standing Still
If standing still for a turn, it is easier +10 to hit you.

### Damage

Damage is not rolled for. A specific weapon, combat style or magic. They all have a fixed base damage value. The base value can then be modified depending on how good your success was and by other means, such as magical abilities and talents.

### Block & Parry

Block and parry are reactions that can soak damage. They do not directly avoid the damage but instead a successful block or parry gives defense points for that round. The amount of points are based on the type of weapon or shield used to block. You use the skill of the shield or weapon for check.


## Making an attack

1. Combatant A say their indent: “I would like to shot X with a bow”
2. Combatant A rolls for hit. Skill chance as highest bound of the roll.
3a. If critical hit, Combatant lookup critical hit table.
3b. Announce Degree of success or failure
3c. Calculate Damage
4. Combatant B might optionally announce use a reaction.
4. GM describe the situation and result.

```
Jonah have the dark snake long bow and the passive talent Marksman. He enter combat with a wolf.
Dark snake long bow
Old runes cover the upper and lower limb of the bow. It looks like a serpent circling, squeezing its victim.

Jonah rolls 34 and have 68% chance in archery. He have success.
Long bow: 6 damage
6+4= 10 dmg

GM looks up the wolf avoidance score of 14 as such no avoidance is done. The full damage amount is deducted from the wolf. Wolf have defense because of thick fur of 3. As such, those defesne points are first deducted and then 7 damage is removed from his health points. As the wolf had 10 hp to start, he now severely injured with 3 hp left.
```

# Experience & Progression

Whenever you use a skill, if you fail you get a skill xp. You can max have 3 unused skill xp per skill. These can be used to add one point to that skill during a long rest. 
Whenever you critical hit you receive 1 crit xp. These can be used to buy talents. 

# Economy

Silver is the main currency used. For cheaper items, the silver is hacked into smaller pieces. Other items such as tobacco, alcohol and furs are often used as barter items also.
