## Introduction

Eda is a dark fantasy roleplaying game of magic, wonder, and perilous adventure. While the world is filled with supernatural forces, magic often carries heavy consequences for those who dare to wield it.

Life in Eda is harsh and often short. It was not always so; legends speak of a prosperous land where peace and harmony once reigned. The name Eda itself is said to mean "Wondrous" in a long-forgotten tongue. Today, few believe these old stories, and they are whispered only in the safety of dimly lit taverns or behind locked doors.

Common people are scared not only of darkness, monsters, and other creatures roaming the countryside but also of religious fanatics, powerful clans, and corrupt governments. Rulers are often bandits, scoundrels, and men trying to prey on the weak. Then there are diseases, harsh weather, and pests eating the crops. Life is not easy for those trying to do good.

![Jonah at the River](images/jonah_river.png)

> Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. A river passed by the back side of the house. Jonah walked to get water for dinner. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the lute. He bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.


## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A tabletop role-playing game is played with a group of friends. One acts as a game master (GM). The rest will take control of a player character (PC). The players act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide them. Together the players and the GM create a collaborative adventure.

The primary goal is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance, your group might feel like changing some aspects on how you feel to play the game and that is great! Homebrewing of the rules are encouraged. 

The game is divided into Adventures and Campaigns.

*   **Adventure**: A short story or quest.
*   **Campaign**: A series of adventures connected together by a continuing storyline.

## Dice Mechanics

Dice are used to decide outcomes of uncertain actions. Eda uses two 10-sided dice to represent numbers from 01-100, referred to as a d100.

*   **Primary Dice**: Represents the 10s (00, 10, 20... 90).
*   **Secondary Dice**: Represents the 1s (0-9).

> ### Example: Rolling the Dice
>
> A "70" on the primary and "5" on the secondary equals 75.
>
> Two "0"s equal 100.
>
> Note on Rounding: When dividing values (e.g., Skill / 2), always round down. Example: 75 / 2 = 37.

## Game Sessions

While the duration of play is up to each group, sessions typically last 4–5 hours. This allows enough time for the story to unfold without causing player fatigue. Ultimately, you should choose a pace that ensures the most enjoyment for your group.

**Session 0**: It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure fully but make sure everyone has a character created, backstories are done, and expectations are set regarding the tone of the game.

## Core Mechanics

### Checks

When a character attempts an action with an uncertain outcome, the game master (GM) will call for a check. To make a check, roll a d100 (two ten-sided dice).

*   **Success**: Roll under or equal to your skill or attribute value.
*   **Failure**: Roll over your skill or attribute value.

Success is not only if you succeeded in something or not. Eda uses degree of sucess to see how good you performed something. Failure might also have different consquences but is decided by the GM only and not measured by dice. A failure is a failure.

### Degree of Success (DoS)

Eda uses a "blackjack" style system where you want to roll as high as possible without exceeding your skill value. The quality of your success is measured by the degree of success (DoS).

*   Calculating DoS: Your DoS is equal to the tens digit of your successful roll.
    *   *Example*: A roll of 48 provides 4 DoS.

> ### Example: Calculating DoS
>
> Bjorn (Skill 70) attempts to track a wolf.
>
> *   He rolls a 65: Success! The tens digit is 6, so he achieves 6 DoS.
> *   He rolls a 12: Success! The tens digit is 1, so he achieves 1 DoS.
> *   He rolls a 75: Failure! He achieves 0 DoS.

### Critical Success

*   **Critical Success**: A pair (11, 22, 33...) that is under or equal to your skill value.
    *   **Combat**: Deals critical damage (weapon damage + tens digit of the skill) AND inflicts a **Wound** (see Damage & Health section).
    *   **Non-Combat**: Automatically fulfills the required degrees of success for any difficulty level.

### Difficulty Modifiers

Some tasks are harder than others and the GM might require a minimum number of degrees of success to succeed.

> ### Example: Bjorn swimming in the river
>
> Bjorn ended up in the river with his chainmail and a strong current,
> while he can swim he is struggling to reach the shore.
>
> *   He rolls a 65: Success! The tens digit is 6, so he achieves 6 DoS. The GM had decided 2 DoS would be enough in this case.

| Difficulty          | Requirement | Description                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**            | 0 DoS       | Routine tasks with no significant pressure.     |
| **Routine**         | 1 DoS       | Standard professional tasks.                    |
| **Challenge**       | 2 DoS       | Demanding tasks requiring focus and skill.      |
| **Hard**            | 4 DoS       | Significant obstacles; requires expertise.      |
| **Extreme**         | 6 DoS       | At the edge of human capability.                |
| **Near Impossible** | 8 DoS       | Practically legendary feats; requires a Master. |


### Advantage & Disadvantage

When you have advantage or disadvantage, you roll d100 as normal, but you can swap which die is the primary (tens) and which is the secondary (units). This allows you to choose between two possible results from a single roll.

*   **Advantage**: You select the best result. The best result is defined as the successful roll that provides the highest degree of success (DoS).
*   **Disadvantage**: You must take the worst result.

> ### Example: Advantage Swap
>
> Bjorn (Skill 70) rolls with advantage. He rolls a 2 and a 6.
>
> *   Option A: 26 (2 DoS)
> *   Option B: 62 (6 DoS)
>
> Bjorn picks 62. It is still under his skill (70), but it provides a higher DoS.

### Opposing Rolls

When two characters compete (e.g., an arm wrestling match or hiding from a guard), both make a check.

*   **Highest Successful Roll Wins**: If both succeed, the character with the highest successful roll wins (degree of success).
*   **Single Success**: If one succeeds and the other fails, the successful character wins.
*   **Double Failure**: If both fail, the situation remains unchanged.

### Pushing the Limit

Before rolling, a player can declare they are "Pushing."

*   Effect: You gain advantage on the roll.
*   Cost: Regardless of success or failure, you lose 10 instinct points (IP).

> Instinct points (IP) represent your character's subconscious and willpower. They are a pool of points that can be spent to push yourself or are lost when facing horrific sights. If your instinct points reach 0, you become frightened. See section Body & Mind in character creation for how to calculate your maximum IP.


## Character Creation

![Adventurers of Eda](images/adventurers_group.png)

Character creation is the process of defining your protagonist's strengths, history, and motivations. A character is defined by the following elements:

1.  **Lineage**: Your raw physical and mental potential.
2.  **Body & Mind**: Derived values for health and instinct.
3.  **Heritage**: Your cultural background.
4.  **Skills**: Specialized training and knowledge.
5.  **Combat Styles**: Mastery of specific weapon styles.
6.  **Course of Life**: Your character's history and goals.
7.  **Equipment**: The gear you have..

> ### Example: Character Creation (Bjorn the Brave)
>
> Step 1: Lineage: Bjorn chooses Lineage A. Attributes: STR 70, AGI 65, LOG 60, INS 40, CHA 60, CON 65.
>
> Step 2: Body & Mind: He calculates 65 HP (equal to CON), 20 IP (INS / 2), and a pool of 6 Reactions (tens digit of AGI).
>
> Step 3: Heritage: He picks Clansman. Trait: Grim Resolve. Skills: Trained in Survival and Intimidate. Talent: He selects the Shield Wall talent from the Master Table. Gear: A whetstone and a flask of "North-Burn."
>
> Step 4: Skills: Bjorn is already trained in survival and intimidate from his heritage. He chooses 3 more trained skills: athletics, warfare, and perception.
>
> Step 5: Combat Styles: Bjorn selects the one-handed & shield combat style.
>
> Step 6: Course of Life: Bjorn is a veteran of the Frost Wars, seeking to protect his village from the creeping ice. He is brave but cautious.
>
> Step 7: Equipment: Bjorn starts with 60 sp from his Clansman heritage. He purchases a Hand Axe (30sp), a bedroll (2sp), a tinderbox (2sp), and 5 days of rations (10sp). He also carries his whetstone from his heritage, leaving him with 16 sp.

*   **Base Skill**: Your base score in any skill is equal to its associated Attribute / 2.
*   **Trained**: You are specialized in this skill. A Trained skill is equal to its associated Attribute in full. At character creation, you gain 2 Trained Skills from your Heritage, 1 Combat Style, and select 3 additional Trained Skills from the list below. After that you can increase your skills by using XP.

## Talents

### The Talent Pyramid

![The Talent Pyramid](images/talent_pyramid.png)

To ensure a broad base of abilities, you must follow the Talent Pyramid. You cannot specialize in high-tier powers without a foundation of lower-tier skills.

*   Tier 1: Cost 5 XP.
*   Tier 2: Cost 10 XP.
*   Tier 3: Cost 15 XP.
*   Tier 4: Cost 20 XP.

> **The Rule of More**: At any time, you must have more talents in a given tier than you have in the tier directly above it.
> *   Example: To take your first Tier 2 talent, you must have at least two Tier 1 talents. To take a second Tier 2 talent, you must have at least three Tier 1 talents.
>
> **Tag Path Rule**: To take a Talent of Tier 2 or higher with a specific heritage, you must already possess at least one talent with that same in the tier directly below it. (e.g., to take a T2 [Warden] talent, you must have at least one T1 [Warden] talent).

## Encounters

![Combat Scenario](images/combat_scene.png)

Combat in Eda is resolved in a series of rounds. Each round represents approximately 10 seconds of in-game time. During a round each combatant take one turn each.

### Initiative

At the start of every round, only the player characters (PCs) roll for initiative. Roll a check against your AGI.

*   **Vanguard Turn (Success)**: If you succeed, you act before the enemies.
*   **Rearguard Turn (Failure)**: If you fail, you act after the enemies.
*   **Enemies**: All enemies act between the vanguard and rearguard turns.
*   **Group Coordination**: Players acting in the same turn (Vanguard or Rearguard) may act in any order they choose.

### Actions

On your turn, you receive 2 Action Points (AP) and 1 Zero Cost Action.

#### Standard Actions

*   **Move (1 AP)**: Move a distance up to your Speed (AGI / 10 meters).
    *   **Evasive Stance**: If you move at least 3 meters during your turn, you gain the evasive status until the start of your next turn. You gain +3 defense against all attacks while you are evasive.
*   **Attack (1 AP)**: Make an attack using a combat style.
    *   **Multiple Attack Penalty (MAP)**: If you perform more than one attack action in a single turn, any attack after the first is made at /2 skill chance.
*   **Help (1 AP)**: Assist an ally within melee range, granting them advantage on their next action.
*   **Interact (1 AP)**: Open a door, light a torch, or manipulate an object.
*   **Swap Weapon (1 AP)**: Draw or sheathe a weapon.
*   **Mount/Dismount (1 AP)**: Get on or off a mount or vehicle.
*   **Stand Up (1 AP)**: Rise from a prone or seated position.
*   **Use Talent/Skill (Variable)**: Use an ability as described in its text (usually 1 AP).
*   **Prepare (1 AP)**: Save an action to be used as a reaction later in the round.

#### The Wait Action
A player in the vanguard turn can spend their zero cost action to wait. This drops them to the rearguard turn, effectively trading initiative for better positioning, observation, or recovery.

*   **Momentum**: By waiting and observing the enemy, the player gains momentum. When acting in the rearguard turn, they regain 1 spent reaction to their pool.

### Damage & Health

*   **Damage**: Total damage is calculated as weapon base damage + degree of success (DoS).
*   **Reduction**: Damage is reduced by **Defense** (the sum of armor and shield values) before being applied to HP.
*   **Death**: At 0 HP.

### Wounds & Injuries

Combat in Eda is dangerous. While Hit Points (HP) represent your overall health, **Wounds** and **Injuries** represent  physical trauma that degrades your ability to fight.

#### Bleeding
Every attack that deals damage (after armor reduction) inflicts the **Bleeding** condition.

*   **Trigger:** Any damaging hit.
*   **Effect:** Bleeding represents the cumulative toll of minor cuts and fatigue. While Bleeding, your **Defense is reduced by 2**. This penalty does not stack.
*   **Duration:** Bleeding persists until the end of the combat encounter.
*   **Treatment:** A successful **Medicine check** (Action) can remove the Bleeding condition.

#### 2. Injuries
When a character suffers a **Critical Hit** (rolling doubles under the attacker's skill, e.g., 11, 22, 33), they suffer an **Injury** in addition to the normal damage.

*   **Roll:** The player always roll a d100 on the **Injury Table**.
*   **Effect:** The table provides both a narrative description and a mechanical penalty (e.g., Stunned, Disadvantage, Broken Limb).
*   **Note:** Injuries are distinct from Bleeding and have their own specific durations/cures.

#### Injury Table (d100)

### Cover
Cover is a vital part of tactical survival. Represents the difficulty of hitting a target partially or fully obscured by the environment.

#### Cover Types
| Type     | Examples                                    | Mechanical Effect                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| **None** | Open field, empty hallway.                  | No bonus.                                 |
| **Half** | Bushes, crates, furniture, other creatures. | Disadvantage for the attacker.        |
| **Full** | Behind a solid wall, inside a room.         | Cannot be targeted by direct attacks. |


### Reactions & Active Defense

Survival in Eda depends on your ability to react to incoming threats. However, physical and mental exhaustion is a factor—characters have a limited pool of Reactions for an entire encounter. This pool does not replenish during combat except through specific actions or talents.

*   Reaction Pool: Your total pool of reactions for the entire encounter is equal to the tens digit of your AGI (e.g., AGI 65 provides 6 reactions).

> ### Conserving Your Strength
>
> In Eda, combat is fast and brutal. Because your Reaction Pool is finite, every choice to Dodge, Parry, or Block is a strategic gamble. Once your reactions are spent, you are left completely vulnerable. Players must decide whether to expend their energy early or save it for the enemy's most devastating strikes.

#### Active Defense Options
When you are targeted by an attack, you may spend 1 Reaction from your pool to perform one of the following:

*   **Dodge (AGI Check)**:
    *   Success: You move out of the way. You take no damage.
    *   Failure: You fail to move in time. You take full damage.
*   **Parry (combat style check)**:
    *   Success: You deflect the blow with your weapon. Reduce incoming damage by your weapon damage + DoS.
    *   Failure: Your guard is broken. You take full damage.
*   **Block (shield skill check)**:
    *   Success: You catch the blow on your shield. Reduce incoming damage by your shield defense + DoS.
    *   Failure: The shield absorbs some impact. You take half damage.

## Conditions & Status Effects

Conditions represent various physical, mental, or situational states that can affect a character. Most conditions are temporary, but they can be deadly if ignored.

Fear is a force that erodes your instinct. Anything that causes fear reduces your current IP directly. Unlike HP, IP does not naturally recover without rest or special items. If your IP reaches 0, you gain the condition frightened until you recover your maximum IP.

**Morale check**: A check to resist fear or intimidation. This is an opposing roll (e.g., attacker's CHA vs. target's INS).

| Condition       | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blinded**     | You cannot see. All your attacks have disadvantage. You automatically fail any check relying on sight. Attackers have advantage on attacks against you.                  |
| **Frightened**  | You are overwhelmed by fear. You have disadvantage on all skill and attribute checks. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear.                           |
| **Hidden**      | You are unseen and unheard. You have advantage on your next attack. If you attack or move into the open, the condition ends. See stealth skill for more details.         |
| **Immobilized** | Your movement is restricted. Your speed is 0. You cannot use the move or the charge actions. You have disadvantage on dodge checks.                          |
| **Prone**       | You are lying on the ground. Ranged attacks against you have disadvantage, but melee attacks against you have advantage. Standing up costs 1 AP.           |
| **Restrained**  | You are immobilized and have disadvantage on all attack rolls. Attackers have advantage on attacks against you.                                                      |
| **Stunned**     | You are momentarily dazed. You cannot take actions or reactions. Attackers have advantage on attacks against you.                                                            |
| **Unconscious** | You are totally unaware of your surroundings. You are prone and stunned. You automatically fail all checks. Any successful attack against you is a critical success. |


Status effects represent the toll of the environment and biological needs on the body.

| Effect          | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bleeding**    | Your defenses are compromised. You have -2 to Defense. Removed by Medicine check. |
| **Burning**     | You are on fire. Take 2 damage at the start of each of your turns. You can spend 1 AP to attempt an agility check to douse the flames. (routine, 1 DoS for small fires, challenge, 2 DoS for large).                                       |
| **Cold**        | Extreme cold numbs your body. You have disadvantage on all agility checks. If you do not find warmth, you must succeed on a constitution check (routine, 1 DoS) every hour or take 2 damage.                                                         |
| **Exhaustion**  | You are physically or mentally spent. Exhaustion has 3 levels: <br>1. Disadvantage on all attribute checks. <br>2. Speed is halved and disadvantage on all skill checks. <br>3. You fall unconscious. <br>A full rest removes 1 level of exhaustion. |
| **Heat**        | Blistering heat drains your stamina. You double your consumption of water. If you do not have water, you must succeed on a constitution check (routine, 1 DoS) every hour or gain 1 level of exhaustion.                                                     |
| **Poisoned**    | Toxins are in your system. You have disadvantage on all strength and constitution checks. Take 1 damage at the start of each of your turns unless the poison is neutralized with a constitution check (challenge, 2 DoS).                        |
| **Starvation**  | You lack nourishment. After 3 days without food, you gain 1 level of exhaustion every 24 hours. This cannot be recovered until you eat a full meal.                                                                                                                  |
| **Suffocating** | You cannot breathe. In calm situations, you can hold your breath for CON / 10 minutes (minimum 1). In high-stress situations (combat), you must succeed on a constitution check every round or gain 1 level of exhaustion. If you reach level 3, you die.    |

## Environmental Hazards

### Falling

Gravity is a lethal foe. When you fall from a height of 3 meters or more, you take damage upon landing.

*   **Damage**: 5 damage for every 3 meters fallen.
*   **Mitigation**: You may attempt an Acrobatics check (Challenge, 2 DoS) to halve the falling damage.

## Adventuring

### Downtime

During periods of extended peace or between adventures, characters enter Downtime. Provided they have access to settlements or trade hubs, players may spend their currency on equipment, repairs, or lifestyle services. Downtime is also an ideal time for roleplaying personal goals, such as training, research, or tending to wounds.

### Rest & Recovery

#### Normal Rest
A standard rest requires at least 8 hours of sleep. Minor interruptions do not negate the benefits of a rest, provided no significant physical exertion occurs.

*   **HP Recovery**: You recover 4 + (CON Tens Digit) HP per night of normal sleep.
*   **IP Recovery**: You recover INS Tens Digit IP per night of normal sleep.

### Injuries & Diseases

In *Eda*, getting hurt means more than just losing Hit Points. When a character is pushed to their breaking point, they suffer lasting injuries that require time and care to heal.

#### Injury System
(See **Wounds & Injuries** section in Combat for details on Critical Injuries and Bleeding.)

#### Disease System

In the grime and filth of *Eda*, disease is a constant companion. Poor hygiene, tainted water, and untreated wounds claim more lives than any monster.

**Transmission**
*   **Airborne**: Close proximity to infected.
*   **Bloodborne**: Bites, scratches, sharing needles/blades.
*   **Ingested**: Tainted food/water.
*   **Touch**: Direct skin contact.

**Sample Diseases**

*   **Gut-Rot (Dysentery)**
    *   *Transmission*: Ingested (Tainted water, spoiled food).
    *   *Incubation*: 1 day.
    *   *Effect*: Violent vomiting and cramps. The character cannot recover Hit Points or Exhaustion from rest.
    *   *Cure*: Clean water, bed rest, and *Charcoal Paste* (Alchemy/Nature).

*   **Filth Fever (Sepsis)**
    *   *Transmission*: Bloodborne (Untreated deep gash or dirty blade).
    *   *Incubation*: 1d10 hours.
    *   *Effect*: High fever and delirium. The character suffers Disadvantage on all INS and LOG checks and cannot receive natural healing.
    *   *Cure*: Amputation (if on limb), Maggots (to eat rot), or strong antibiotics (rare).

*   **Lung-Blight (Consumption)**
    *   *Transmission*: Airborne (Close contact, coughing).
    *   *Incubation*: 1d10 weeks (Long dormancy).
    *   *Effect*: Chronic cough and bloody phlegm. -20 to Athletics checks, and strenuous activity causes 1d10 damage.
    *   *Cure*: None known. Symptoms managed with *Soothing Tea* (Herbalism). Move to dry climate helps.

*   **The Shakes**
    *   *Transmission*: Ingested (Eating infected meat/cannibalism).
    *   *Incubation*: 1d10 months.
    *   *Effect*: Uncontrollable tremors. -20 to DEX/AGI checks and Disadvantage on all attacks.
    *   *Cure*: None.

#### Medical Treatment

Treatment in *Eda* is not for the faint of heart. Without modern anesthesia, surgery is a trauma in itself.

**The Medicine Skill**
*   **Medicine**: Stop *Bleeding*, stabilize dying.
*   **Long-Term Care (Challenge, 2 DoS)**: Treat disease, aid natural healing (+2 HP/day).
*   **Surgery (Hard, 4 DoS)**: Repair severe injuries.
*   **Amputation (Extreme, 6 DoS)**: Remove limb to cure severe disease/injury.

**The Cost of Treatment**
*   **Pain**: Surgery requires a CON check (Challenge, 2 DoS). Failure means the patient loses 1d10 IP from the trauma/pain. If IP reaches 0, the character passes out (Unconscious).
*   **Shock**: If the surgery fails (Medicine check failed), the patient takes damage equal to the "Pain" roll and gains 1 level of Exhaustion.
*   **Tools**: Improvised tools (rusty knife, fire) give Disadvantage. Proper tools (scalpel, clamps) are required for surgeries without penalty.
*   **Sanitation**: Performing surgery in a dungeon or swamp gives -20 penalty.

**Herbalism & Supplies**
*   **Bitter-Moss**: Chewed to numb pain (Advantage on Pain CON check).
*   **North-Burn**: High-proof spirits. Used to sterilize (removes Sanitation penalty) or dull pain (Advantage on Pain checks). See *Alchemical Items* for combat use.
*   **Cauterization**: Using fire/hot iron to stop bleeding/amputate. Stops bleeding instantly but deals 1d10 fire damage and causes a Pain check.

**Integration with Rules**
*   **Conditions**: Diseases often inflict existing conditions like *Exhaustion*, *Poisoned*, or *Bleeding*.
*   **Infected Condition**: A character with an active disease or untreated Severe Injury is *Infected*. They cannot recover HP from natural rest.

## Equipment & Economy

Currency is based on the weight and purity of precious metals. While many remote clans still rely on barter, most settled areas use a standardized coinage system.

### Denominations

*   **Copper (cp)**: A thin, stamped copper disc used for everyday purchases.
*   **Silver (sp)**: The standard unit of trade. Most goods are priced in silver pieces. (100 cp = 1 sp).
*   **Gold (gp)**: Large, heavy coins often dating back long in history. Used only for significant transactions, such as buying land or high-quality livestock. (100sp = 1 gp).

### Hacksilver & Barter

In the rugged wilds, coins are often rare. Travelers frequently use Hacksilver—pieces of silver jewelry, arm-rings, or even coins cut into halves or quarters—which are valued by weight.

Outside major trade hubs, barter is the primary form of exchange. A character might trade a bundle of furs for a night's stay and a hot meal. When haggling over significant trades, the GM may call for a CHA or Appraise check. Opposing rolls for haggling might occur. 

### Common Goods & Services

## Magic & Rituals

![Casting a Spell](images/spellcasting.png)

Magic in Eda is a gnarly, dangerous practice that draws power from the subconscious and the darker corners of the world. It is a strategic gamble; because characters have limited Instinct Points (IP) and magic takes a physical toll, most practitioners must rely on their mundane skills and weapons until a situation becomes desperate.

### Spells

All spells require a successful **INS check** (including the required DoS). Combat magic focuses on visceral effects and immediate conditions.

| Name | IP | Difficulty | Description & Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blight** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You exhale a cloud of flies and bile. **Cone (3m). Target takes 5 + DoS damage and the Poisoned condition.** |
| **Veil of Blood** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You slice your palm and blow the droplets into a fine, red fog. **5m Area. Anyone inside takes the Bleeding condition.** |
| **Vomit Fire** | 10 | Challenge (2 DoS) | You swallow a coal; your ribs glow before you vomit a ball of flame. **8 + DoS Fire Damage + Burning condition.** |
| **Clay Grasp** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You whisper to the earth; clay hands rise to seize the ankles of your foe. **Target is Immobilized + Restrained.** |
| **Salt Statue** | 10 | Challenge (2 DoS) | You blow white dust at a foe; their skin hardens into cracked salt. **Target is Stunned for 1 round.** |
| **Pluck the Eye** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You make a hooking motion in the air; the target's eyes roll back into their head. **Target is Blinded for 1 round.** |
| **The Knot** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You twist a rag in your hands; the target's bowels knot in agony. **Target is knocked Prone and takes 3 + DoS damage.** |
| **Witch Wall** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You weave your fingers in a pattern that blurs your physical form. **Caster gains Evasive status.** |
| **Crow Senses** | 5 | Routine (1 DoS) | You coat your eyes in crow-fat to blend into the dark. **Caster gains Hidden condition in shadows.** |

### Rituals
Rituals are powerful, utility-focused magical operations that cannot be cast in combat. They require a prepared space, specific ingredients, and significant time.

### Ritual Rules

*   Requirements: Must have the Rituals (T2) Witch Talent.
*   Time: 1 Hour (Standard).
*   Cost: 10 IP + Material Cost (Gold/Ingredients).
*   Check: Roll INS vs difficulty (DoS). Most standard rituals require 1 DoS (routine). Powerful rituals may require 2-4 DoS.

#### Ritual Outcomes

*   Success: The ritual works as intended.
*   Critical success (pair under skill): No IP cost, and the effect is doubled or enhanced.
*   Failure: No effect. Lose IP and materials. Lose 2 additional IP due to fear.
*   Critical failure (roll 95-100): The ritual backfires. The GM determines a negative consequence. Lose 5 additional IP due to fear.

## Game Master Section

### Progress Clocks

Progress clocks are a visual tool used by the game master to track the flow of events, the progress of a complex task, or the approaching threat of a looming danger.

A clock is a circle divided into segments—typically 4, 6, or 8. As events unfold, the GM fills in these segments to represent progress.

### Types of Clocks

*   Objective Clocks: Used to track the players' progress toward a goal, such as "Sneak into the Fortress" or "Research the Ancient Curse."
*   Danger Clocks: Represent a growing threat or a countdown to a negative event, such as "The Guards are Alerted" or "The Ritual Completes."
*   Linked Clocks: Sometimes, one clock must be completed before another can begin. For example, a "Find the Secret Entrance" (4 segments) clock might need to be filled before the "Infiltrate the Vault" (6 segments) clock starts.
*   Mission Clocks: Track the overall progress of a large-scale operation or adventure.

### Filling a Clock

Segments are usually filled based on the outcome of rolls:

*   Success: Fill 1 segment.
*   Critical success: Fill 2 or 3 segments.
*   Failure on a risky action: The GM may fill 1 or 2 segments on a related danger clock.

### Why Use Clocks?

Clocks provide transparency and tension. They allow players to see exactly how close they are to success or disaster, making their choices feel more impactful. They are especially useful for situations that shouldn't be resolved by a single roll but require a series of actions.

### Running the Game

This section provides concrete guidance for managing the challenges of Eda at the table.

### Handling Lethality & Success

Eda is a dangerous world. Success is never guaranteed, and failure should always carry weight.

#### The Cost of Failure
Avoid "nothing happens" on a failed roll. Instead, introduce a concrete consequence:

*   Strength Failure: You force the door open, but your shoulder is bruised (Lose 1d10 HP) or your crowbar snaps.
*   Logic Failure: You decipher the map, but it takes so long that the sun sets, consuming time and light resources.
*   Agility Failure: You sneak past the guard, but drop a pouch of 5 sp that clatters on the stone.

#### Success with a Cost
Sometimes a player fails a roll by a small margin. You can offer them the choice to succeed at a cost.

*   *Example*: "You catch the ledge, but the strain costs you 5 IP as panic sets in."

#### Theater of the Mind & Tactical Combat

In Eda, you can resolve encounters using either Theater of the Mind or tactical maps. Theater of the Mind (TotM) relies on narrative descriptions and is often the best choice for social encounters, travel, or quick skirmishes where precise positioning isn't critical. It keeps the story moving and allows for high flexibility.

However, because of the depth of Eda’s mechanical systems, **Combat** is usually more satisfying and clear when handled **tactically** with a grid or map. It is ultimately up to the GM and the players to choose the style that fits the current scene best.

**Benefits of Tactical Combat:**
- **Precision of Movement**: Features like *Evasive Stance* (moving 3m+) and specific weapon reaches (like *Pikes* with 3m reach) are much easier to adjudicate when distances are concrete.
- **Resource Management**: The *Reaction Pool* is a finite resource. Seeing exactly how many enemies can reach you allows players to make better strategic gambles on when to Dodge, Parry, or Block.
- **Cover and Positioning**: Tactical maps remove disputes about whether a character has *Half* or *Full Cover* or if they are successfully *Flanking* an opponent.
- **Battlefield Control**: Talents that affect areas or multiple targets are more impactful when the spatial relationships between combatants are visible.

> #### GM Tip: Tracking Bleeding
> Because damaging hits inflicts the **Bleeding** condition, keeping track of it for multiple NPCs and PCs can become a chore. 
> 
> Use physical markers—such as red plastic rings, small red dice, or red translucent tokens—and place them directly on or next to the miniature on the map. This provides an immediate visual cue of who is losing blood.

### Practical Rules Application

*   The Art of the Roll: Only call for a roll when:
    1.  The character is under pressure (time, danger, or social stakes).
    2.  The outcome is uncertain.
    3.  Failure has a concrete consequence.
*   Narrating degrees of success (DoS): Use the DoS to describe the quality of the action:
    *   1 DoS (Routine): You get the job done, but it’s messy or takes effort.
    *   4 DoS (Hard): You perform the task with professional grace and efficiency.
    *   8 DoS (Near Impossible): You perform a legendary feat that leaves witnesses in awe.


## Progression

The progression system in Eda rewards failure and provides consistent growth, ensuring low skills improve quickly while high skills plateau.

### The Fumble Points

*   Trigger: Your skill improves immediately when you roll a Critical Fumble.
*   Definition of Critical Fumble:
    1. Rolling a pair (11, 22, 33, ..., 00) that is ABOVE your skill value.
    
        *   *Example*: Skill 45. Roll 77. (Fail + pair) -> fumble. Skill increases to 46.
*   The Reward: When you Fumble, increase that skill by 1 point permanently. This represents learning from a spectacular failure.

### Milestones & Growth

After every major encounter, significant discovery, or successful completion of a goal, the GM awards players 2–5 Experience Points (XP). As a general rule, players should receive about 5 XP for every day of active adventuring.

**Spending XP:**

*   Buy Talents: T1 = 5 XP, T2 = 10 XP, T3 = 15 XP, T4 = 20 XP.
*   Increase attributes: +1 to any attribute = 10 XP.
*   Steady Training: 1 XP increases a trained skill score by 1 point.
*   Unlock Skill: 5 XP to turn an untrained skill into a trained skill.
