# Eda

> ### Preface
>
> Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. A river passed by the back side of the house. Jonah walked to get water for dinner. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the piano. He bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.

## Introduction

Eda is a dark fantasy game. While still having magic, wonders and amazing adventure. Magic and supernatural things usually have higher consequences both for someone using it and anyone that gets targeted by it.

Living in Eda can be tough and deadly. It was not always this way; once upon a time, the stories tell about a prosperous land where most people lived in peace and harmony. The name Eda itself is said to have meant “Wonderous” in an ancient language long forgotten. Nowadays not many still believe in the legends, and they are mostly whispered quietly over a drink in a dimly lit tavern or hiding in your home.

Common people are scared not only of darkness, monsters, and other creatures roaming the countryside but also of religious fanatics, powerful clans, and corrupt governments. Rulers are often bandits, scoundrels, and men trying to prey on the weak. Then there are diseases, harsh weather, and pests eating the crops. Life is not easy for those trying to do good.

## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A tabletop role-playing game is played with a group of friends. One acts as a Game Master (GM). The rest will take control of a Player Character (PC). The players act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide them. Together the players and the GM create a collaborative adventure.

The primary goal is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance only, and your group might feel like changing some aspects to make it more fun.

The game is divided into Adventures and Campaigns.

*   **Adventure**: A short story or quest.
*   **Campaign**: A series of adventures connected together by a continuing storyline.

## Dice Mechanics

Dice are used to decide outcomes of uncertain actions. Eda uses two 10-sided dice to represent numbers from 01-100, referred to as **d100**.

*   **Primary Dice**: Represents the 10s (00, 10, 20... 90).
*   **Secondary Dice**: Represents the 1s (0-9).

> ### Example: Rolling the Dice
>
> A "70" on the primary and "5" on the secondary equals **75**.
>
> Two "0"s equal **100**.

> **Note on Rounding**: When dividing values (e.g., Skill / 2), always **round down**. Example: 75 / 2 = 37.

## Game Sessions

It is up to the group to decide how long to play, but a general tip is to keep sessions around 4-5 hours for both getting into stories but at the same time not play on fumes but everyone is different so do what is most fun for you and your group.

**Session 0**: It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure fully but make sure everyone has a character created, backstories are done, and expectations are set regarding the tone of the game.

## Playing the Game

### Checks

Roll d100 (01-100).

*   **Success**: Roll UNDER or EQUAL to your Skill/Attribute.
*   **Failure**: Roll OVER your Skill/Attribute.

#### Degree of Success
  
The amount of success. Recorded as the number of the ten digits. Example a roll of 48 would be 4 degree of success. Many different mechanics in the game uses how much you succeed in something and it also impact how much damage your attacks do.


#### Critical Success & Failure

*   **Critical Success**: A **Pair** under or equal to the skill value (11, 22, 33...).
    *  In combat a Critical Success deals **Critical Damage**: Weapon Base Damage + Maximum Degree of Success (Tens Digit of the Skill). This replaces the normal damage calculation for that hit.
    *   Difficulty Bypass: In non-combat checks, a Critical Success automatically fulfills the required Degrees of Success for any difficulty level.

*   **Critical Failure (Fumble)**: A **Pair** above the skill value or a roll of **100 (00)** (if above the skill).
    *   **The Fumble Reward**: Eda uses a "fail forward" mechanic. When you Critical Failure, you immediately increase that skill by **1 point** permanently as you learn from the error. See the section **Fumble Points** for a full explanation.

### Difficulty Modifiers

| Difficulty          | Requirement (DoS) | Description                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**            | 0 DoS             | Routine tasks with no significant pressure.     |
| **Routine**         | 1 DoS             | Standard professional tasks.                    |
| **Challenge**       | 2 DoS             | Demanding tasks requiring focus and skill.      |
| **Hard**            | 4 DoS             | Significant obstacles; requires expertise.      |
| **Extreme**         | 6 DoS             | At the edge of human capability.                |
| **Near Impossible** | 8 DoS             | Practically legendary feats; requires a Master. |

### Advantage & Disadvantage

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage, you roll d100 as normal, but you can swap which die is the primary (tens) and which is the secondary (units). This allows you to choose between two possible results from a single roll.

For example, if you roll a **3** and a **6**, your result can be either **36** or **63**.

*   **Advantage**: You select the best result. The **Best Result** is defined as the successful roll that provides the highest **Degree of Success (DoS)**.
*   **Disadvantage**: You must take the worst result.

> #### Example: The Advantage Choice
> Bjorn has a Skill of **70** and rolls with **Advantage**. He rolls a **2** and a **6**.
> *   Option A: **26** (2 DoS)
> *   Option B: **62** (6 DoS)
>
> Bjorn picks **62**. It is still under his skill (70), but it provides a higher Degree of Success, potentially dealing more damage or satisfying higher difficulty requirements.

### Opposing Rolls

When two characters are competing against each other (e.g., an arm wrestling match or trying to hide from a guard), both parties make a check.

*   Both roll against their respective Skill/Attribute.
*   If both fail, nothing happens or the situation remains unchanged.
*   If one succeeds and the other fails, the successful character wins.
*   If both succeed, the character with the **highest successful roll** wins.
*   **Resisting Effects**: When a spell or ability says "Attribute vs Attribute to resist," it always uses an **Opposing Roll**.

### Pushing the Limit

Before rolling, a player can declare they are "Pushing."

*   **Effect**: You gain **Advantage** on the roll.
*   **Cost**: Regardless of success or failure, you lose **10 Mind Points**.

> **Note on Mind Points**: Mind Points (MP) represent your character's mental focus, sanity, and willpower. They are a pool of points that can be spent to push yourself or are lost when facing horrific sights. If your Mind Points reach 0, you become Frightened. See **Body & Mind** in Character Creation for how to calculate your maximum MP.

## Encounters

Encounters start with iniative roll, each combatant then go in turn order after everyone had their turn. The round is over and the next round start with a new iniative roll.

*   **Success**: The player acts in the Vanguard Turn (before the enemies).
*   **Failure**: The player acts in the Rearguard Turn (after the enemies).
*   **Group Coordination**: Players in the same turn (Vanguard or Rearguard) can act in any order they choose themselves if not clockwise.

### Actions
On your turn, you get 2 Action Points and 1 Zero Cost Action.

#### Standard Actions

*   **Move**: Up to Speed (AGI / 10 meters).
    *   **Evasive Maneuver**: If you move at least 3 meters during your turn, you gain Advantage on all Active Defense rolls (Dodge, Parry, Block) until the start of your next turn.

    *   **Precision**: Advantage on their next skill check or attack.

### Cover
Cover is a vital part of tactical survival. Represents the difficulty of hitting a target partially or fully obscured by the environment.

#### Cover Types
| Type     | Examples                                    | Mechanical Effect                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| **None** | Open field, empty hallway.                  | No bonus.                                 |
| **Half** | Bushes, crates, furniture, other creatures. | **Disadvantage** for the attacker.        |
| **Full** | Behind a solid wall, inside a room.         | **Cannot be targeted** by direct attacks. |


### Reactions & Active Defense

Survival depends on your ability to react to incoming threats. Characters have a **limited pool of Reactions** for an entire encounter. 

**Reactions**: Your total pool of Reactions for the **entire encounter** is equal to the **tens digit of your AGI**. (Example: AGI 65 gives **6 Reactions**).
These do not refresh every round and must be used strategically.

#### Active Defense Options:
When you are targeted by an attack, you may spend one of your limited Reactions to perform one of the following:

*   **Dodge (AGI) (Challenge: 2 DoS)**:
    *   **Success**: You move out of the way. You take **No Damage**.
    *   **Failure**: You take **Full Damage**.
*   **Parry (AGI)**:
    *   **Success**: You deflect the blow. Reduce incoming damage by your **Weapon Damage + Degree of Success**.
    *   **Failure**: You take **Full Damage**.
*   **Block (Combat: Shields)**:
    *   **Success**: You catch the blow on your shield. Reduce incoming damage by **Shield Defense + Degree of Success**.
    *   **Failure**: The shield still absorbs some impact. You take **Half Damage**.

## Conditions & Status Effects

Conditions represent various physical, mental, or situational states that can affect a character. Most conditions are temporary, but they can be deadly if ignored.

Fear is a force that erodes your MIND. Anything that causes Fear reduces your current **Mind Points** directly. Unlike HP, Mind Points do not naturally recover without rest or special items. If your Mind Points reach 0, you get the condition **Frightened** until you recover your **Maximum MIND points**.

**Morale Check**: A check to resist fear or intimidation. This is an **Opposing Roll** (e.g., Attacker's CHA vs. Target's MND).

| Condition       | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Hidden**      | You are unseen and unheard. You have **Advantage** on your next attack. If you attack or move into the open, the condition ends. See **Stealth** skill for more details.         |

| **Prone**       | You are lying on the ground. Ranged attacks against you have **Disadvantage**, but melee attacks against you have **Advantage**. Standing up costs **1 Action Point**.           |
| **Restrained**  | You are **Immobilized** and have **Disadvantage** on all attack rolls. Attackers have **Advantage** on attacks against you.                                                      |
| **Stunned**     | You are momentarily dazed. You cannot take actions or reactions. Attackers have **Advantage** on attacks against you.                                                            |
| **Unconscious** | You are totally unaware of your surroundings. You are **Prone** and **Stunned**. You automatically fail all checks. Any successful attack against you is a **Critical Success**. |


Status effects represent the toll of the environment and biological needs on the body.

## Environmental Hazards

### Falling

Gravity is a lethal foe. When you fall from a height of **3 meters or more**, you take damage upon landing.

*   **Damage**: **5 damage** for every **3 meters** fallen.
*   **Mitigation**: You may attempt an **Acrobatics** check (**Challenge, 2 DoS**) to halve the falling damage.

## Adventuring

### Downtime

If there is a long downtime, depending on if the characters plausibly would have access to shops etc. You are allowed to spend coins on anything that would plausibly be available. It is also okay to perform other type of normal duties such as bathing or go to the barber etc.

### Rest & Recovery

#### Normal Rest
8 hours of sleep. Small interruption of sleep can be included as long as there is no excessive physical exertion.

*   **HP Recovery**: You recover **4 + (CON Tens Digit) HP** per night of normal sleep.
*   **MP Recovery**: You recover **MND Tens Digit** MP per night of normal sleep.

### Health & Injuries

#### Healing Abilities
Using the **Aid** skill to bandage or splint a broken arm can stop bleeding and prevent an injury from getting worse.

## Equipment & Economy

Currency is based on the weight and purity of precious metals. While many remote clans still rely on barter, most settled areas use a standardized coinage system.

#### Denominations

*   **Copper Bit (cp)**: A thin, stamped copper disc used for everyday purchases.
*   **Silver Mark (sp)**: The standard unit of trade. Most goods are priced in Silver Marks. (100 cp = 1 sp).
*   **Gold Crown (gp)**: Large, heavy coins often dating back long in history. Used only for significant transactions, such as buying land or high-quality livestock. (100 sp = 1 gp).

#### Hacksilver & Barter

In the rugged wilds, coins are often rare. Travelers frequently use **Hacksilver**—pieces of silver jewelry, arm-rings, or even coins cut into halves or quarters—which are valued by weight.

Outside major trade hubs, barter is the primary form of exchange. A character might trade a bundle of furs for a night's stay and a hot meal. When haggling over significant trades, the GM may call for a **CHA** or **Appraise** check. Opposing rolls for haggling might occur. 

### Common Goods & Services

## Game Master Section

### Progress Clocks

Progress Clocks are a visual tool used by the Game Master to track the flow of events, the progress of a complex task, or the approaching threat of a looming danger.

A clock is a circle divided into segments—typically 4, 6, or 8. As events unfold, the GM fills in these segments to represent progress.

#### Types of Clocks

*   **Objective Clocks**: Used to track the players' progress toward a goal, such as "Sneak into the Fortress" or "Research the Ancient Curse."
*   **Danger Clocks**: Represent a growing threat or a countdown to a negative event, such as "The Guards are Alerted" or "The Ritual Completes."
*   **Linked Clocks**: Sometimes, one clock must be completed before another can begin. For example, a "Find the Secret Entrance" (4 segments) clock might need to be filled before the "Infiltrate the Vault" (6 segments) clock starts.
*   **Mission Clocks**: Track the overall progress of a large-scale operation or adventure.

#### Filling a Clock

Segments are usually filled based on the outcome of rolls:

*   **Success**: Fill 1 segment.
*   **Critical Success**: Fill 2 or 3 segments.
*   **Failure on a Risky Action**: The GM may fill 1 or 2 segments on a related **Danger Clock**.

#### Why Use Clocks?

Clocks provide transparency and tension. They allow players to see exactly how close they are to success or disaster, making their choices feel more impactful. They are especially useful for situations that shouldn't be resolved by a single roll but require a series of actions.

### Progression
This system rewards failure and provides consistent growth, ensuring low skills improve quickly while high skills plateau.

#### The Fumble Points

*   **Trigger**: Your skill improves **immediately** when you roll a **Critical Fumble**.
*   **Definition of Critical Fumble**:
    1. Rolling a **Pair** (11, 22, 33, ..., 00) that is **ABOVE** your Skill Value.
    
    *   *Example*: Skill 45. Roll 77. (Fail + Pair) -> **Fumble**. Skill increases to 46.
*   **The Reward**: When you Fumble, increase that skill by **1 point** permanently. This represents learning from a spectacular failure.

#### End of session

At the end of every session, all players receive **5 Experience Points (XP)**. This represents the general experience and growth gained from adventuring.

**Spending XP:**

*   **Buy Talents**: T1 = 5 XP, T2 = 10 XP, T3 = 15 XP, T4 = 20 XP.
*   **Increase Attributes**: +1 to any Attribute = 10 XP.
*   **Steady Training**: 1 XP increases a trained Skill score by **2 points**.
*   **Unlock Skill**: 5 XP to turn an untrained skill into a Trained skill.
