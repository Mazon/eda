# Eda

> ### Preface
>
> Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. A river passed by the back side of the house. Jonah walked to get water for dinner. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the piano. He bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.

## Introduction

Eda is a dark fantasy game. While still having magic, wonders and amazing adventure. Magic and supernatural things usually have higher consequences both for someone using it and anyone that gets targeted by it.

Living in Eda can be tough and deadly. It was not always this way; once upon a time, the stories tell about a prosperous land where most people lived in peace and harmony. The name Eda itself is said to have meant “Wonderous” in an ancient language long forgotten. Nowadays not many still believe in the legends, and they are mostly whispered quietly over a drink in a dimly lit tavern or hiding in your home.

Common people are scared not only of darkness, monsters, and other creatures roaming the countryside but also of religious fanatics, powerful clans, and corrupt governments. Rulers are often bandits, scoundrels, and men trying to prey on the weak. Then there are diseases, harsh weather, and pests eating the crops. Life is not easy for those trying to do good.

## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A tabletop role-playing game is played with a group of friends. One acts as a Game Master (GM). The rest will take control of a Player Character (PC). The players act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide them. Together the players and the GM create a collaborative adventure.

The primary goal is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance only, and your group might feel like changing some aspects to make it more fun.

The game is divided into Adventures and Campaigns.

*   **Adventure**: A short story or quest.
*   **Campaign**: A series of adventures connected together by a continuing storyline.

## Dice Mechanics

Dice are used to decide outcomes of uncertain actions. Eda uses two d10 dice of different colors to represent 01-100:

*   **Primary Dice**: Represents the 10s (00, 10, 20... 90).
*   **Secondary Dice**: Represents the 1s (0-9).

> ### Example: Rolling the Dice
>
> A "70" on the primary and "5" on the secondary equals **75**.
>
> Two "0"s equal **100**.

> **Note on Rounding**: When dividing values (e.g., Skill / 2), always **round down**. Example: 75 / 2 = 37.

## Game Sessions

It is up to the group to decide how long to play, but a general tip is to keep sessions around 4-5 hours for both getting into stories but at the same time not play on fumes but everyone is different so do what is most fun for you and your group.

**Session 0**: It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure fully but make sure everyone has a character created, backstories are done, and expectations are set regarding the tone of the game.

## Playing the Game

### Checks

Roll 2d10 (01-100).

*   **Success**: Roll UNDER or EQUAL to your Skill/Attribute.
*   **Failure**: Roll OVER your Skill/Attribute.
*   **Critical Success**: Doubles under skill (11, 22, 33...). A Critical Success deals **Critical Damage**: Weapon Base Damage + Maximum Degree of Success (Tens Digit of the Skill). This replaces the normal damage calculation for that hit.
    *   Difficulty Bypass: In non-combat checks, a Critical Success automatically fulfills the required Degrees of Success for any difficulty level.
    *   Degree of Success: The amount of success. Usually only recorded as the number of ten digits. Example a roll of 48 would be 4 degree of success.

### Difficulty Modifiers

| Difficulty          | Requirement (DoS) | Description                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**            | 0 DoS             | Routine tasks with no significant pressure.     |
| **Routine**         | 1 DoS             | Standard professional tasks.                    |
| **Challenge**       | 2 DoS             | Demanding tasks requiring focus and skill.      |
| **Hard**            | 4 DoS             | Significant obstacles; requires expertise.      |
| **Extreme**         | 6 DoS             | At the edge of human capability.                |
| **Near Impossible** | 8 DoS             | Practically legendary feats; requires a Master. |

### Advantage & Disadvantage

> In other games advantage and disadvantage is usually done by rolling twice. Using 2d10 dice, you can switch what dice is the primary and which is the secondary. This way we only have to roll once.
>
> If roll 36, can either be 36 or 63.

*   **Advantage**: You are allowed to select the best result.
*   **Disadvantage**: Take the worst result.

### Opposing Rolls

When two characters are competing against each other (e.g., an arm wrestling match or trying to hide from a guard), both parties make a check.

*   Both roll against their respective Skill/Attribute.
*   If both fail, nothing happens or the situation remains unchanged.
*   If one succeeds and the other fails, the successful character wins.
*   If both succeed, the character with the **highest successful roll** wins.
*   **Resisting Effects**: When a spell or ability says "Attribute vs Attribute to resist," it always uses an **Opposing Roll**.

### Pushing the Limit

Before rolling, a player can declare they are "Pushing."
*   **Effect**: You gain **Advantage** on the roll.
*   **Cost**: Regardless of success or failure, you lose **5 Mind Points**.

After that you can increase your skills by using XP. Only trained skills can be improved by XP. To "unlock" an untrained skill into a trained skill you need to spend 5 XP at once, representing dedicated training. After that, you can increase the skill score using XP.

## Encounters

Encounters start with iniative roll, each combatant then go in turn order after everyone had their turn. The round is over and the next round start with a new iniative roll.

### Initiative
Only the player characters roll for initiative. Each player rolls against their AGI.

*   **Success**: The player acts in the Vanguard Turn (before the enemies).
*   **Failure**: The player acts in the Rearguard Turn (after the enemies).
*   **Group Coordination**: Players in the same turn (Vanguard or Rearguard) can act in any order they choose themselves if not clockwise.

### Actions
On your turn, you get 2 Action Points and 1 Zero Cost Action.

#### Standard Actions

*   **Move**: Up to Speed (AGI / 10 meters).
    *   **Evasive Maneuver**: If you move at least 3 meters during your turn, you gain Advantage on all Active Defense rolls (Dodge, Parry, Block) until the start of your next turn.
*   **Attack**: Use a combat style.
*   **Help**: Lending your help to an ally, giving advantage on an action. Need to be within melee range.
*   **Activate / Manipulate Item**: Can example open a door, light a candle or smaller simpler tasks that take some time.
*   **Draw / Sheathe Weapon**: To change your weapon, example to switch from your bow to a sword you will need to use a action.
*   **Mount / Dismount**: To mount or dismount animals or a vehicle.

*   **Use Talent/Skill**: Variable cost described by the talent, normally 1 action.

#### The Wait Action
A player in the Vanguard Turn can spend a free Action to Wait. This drops them to the Rearguard Turn, effectively trading iniative for better positioning or observation.

*   **Momentum**: By waiting and observing the enemy, the player gains Momentum. When acting in the Rearguard Turn, they may choose one benefit:
    *   **Precision**: Advantage on their next skill check or attack.

### Damage & Health

*   **Damage**: Total damage is calculated as Weapon Base Damage + Degree of Success (DoS).
*   **Reduction**: Damage is reduced by Defense (Armor/Shields) before being applied to HP.
*   **Death**: At 0 HP.
