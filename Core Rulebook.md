# Eda

> ### Preface
>
> Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. A river passed by the back side of the house. Jonah walked to get water for dinner. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the piano. He bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.

## Introduction

Eda is a dark fantasy roleplaying game of magic, wonder, and perilous adventure. While the world is filled with supernatural forces, magic often carries heavy consequences for those who dare to wield it.

Life in Eda is harsh and often short. It was not always so; legends speak of a prosperous land where peace and harmony once reigned. The name Eda itself is said to mean "Wondrous" in a long-forgotten tongue. Today, few believe these old stories, and they are whispered only in the safety of dimly lit taverns or behind locked doors.

Common people are scared not only of darkness, monsters, and other creatures roaming the countryside but also of religious fanatics, powerful clans, and corrupt governments. Rulers are often bandits, scoundrels, and men trying to prey on the weak. Then there are diseases, harsh weather, and pests eating the crops. Life is not easy for those trying to do good.

## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A tabletop role-playing game is played with a group of friends. One acts as a Game Master (GM). The rest will take control of a Player Character (PC). The players act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide them. Together the players and the GM create a collaborative adventure.

The primary goal is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance, your group might feel like changing some aspects on how you feel to play the game and that is great! Homebrewing of the rules are encouraged. 

The game is divided into Adventures and Campaigns.

*   **Adventure**: A short story or quest.
*   **Campaign**: A series of adventures connected together by a continuing storyline.

## Dice Mechanics

Dice are used to decide outcomes of uncertain actions. Eda uses two 10-sided dice to represent numbers from 01-100, referred to as a **d100**.

*   **Primary Dice**: Represents the 10s (00, 10, 20... 90).
*   **Secondary Dice**: Represents the 1s (0-9).

> ### Example: Rolling the Dice
>
> A "70" on the primary and "5" on the secondary equals **75**.
>
> Two "0"s equal **100**.
>
> **Note on Rounding**: When dividing values (e.g., Skill / 2), always **round down**. Example: 75 / 2 = 37.

## Game Sessions

While the duration of play is up to each group, sessions typically last 4–5 hours. This allows enough time for the story to unfold without causing player fatigue. Ultimately, you should choose a pace that ensures the most enjoyment for your group.

**Session 0**: It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure fully but make sure everyone has a character created, backstories are done, and expectations are set regarding the tone of the game.

## Core Mechanics

### Checks

When a character attempts an action with an uncertain outcome, the Game Master (GM) will call for a **Check**. To make a check, roll a **d100** (two ten-sided dice).

*   **Success**: Roll **UNDER or EQUAL** to your Skill or Attribute value.
*   **Failure**: Roll **OVER** your Skill or Attribute value.

### The Blackjack System & Degree of Success (DoS)

Eda uses a "Blackjack" style system where you want to roll as **high as possible** without exceeding your Skill value. The quality of your success is measured by the **Degree of Success (DoS)**.

*   **Calculating DoS**: Your DoS is equal to the **tens digit** of your successful roll.
    *   *Example*: A roll of **48** provides **4 DoS**.
*   **High Rolls (Near Skill)**: Rolling close to your skill value provides the highest quality of success. For example, with a skill of 70, a roll of 69 provides 6 DoS, while a roll of 12 only provides 1 DoS.

> ### Example: Calculating DoS
>
> Bjorn (Skill 70) attempts to track a wolf.
>
> *   He rolls a **65**: Success! The tens digit is 6, so he achieves **6 DoS**.
> *   He rolls a **12**: Success! The tens digit is 1, so he achieves **1 DoS**.
> *   He rolls a **75**: Failure! He achieves **0 DoS**.

### Critical Success

*   **Critical Success**: A **Pair** (11, 22, 33...) that is under or equal to your skill value.
    *   **Combat**: Deals **Critical Damage** (Weapon Base Damage + Tens Digit of the Skill). This replaces the normal damage calculation for that hit.
    *   **Non-Combat**: Automatically fulfills the required Degrees of Success for any difficulty level.

### Failure

It is up to the GM to decide what outcome might happen if a check have a failure and while there is no specific rule around degree of failure, it is up to the GM if he would like to take that into consideration aswell.

**Critical Failure (Fumble)**: A **Pair** above your skill value, or a roll of **100 (00)**.
*   **The Fumble Reward**: When you Critical Failure, you immediately increase that skill by **1 point** permanently as you learn from your mistakes. See the section **Fumble Points** for a full explanation. 
There is no other specific rules around critical failure.

### Difficulty Modifiers

Some tasks are harder than others and require a minimum number of Degrees of Success to succeed. The GM might require the player to have some degree of success to succeed. 

> ### Example: Bjorn swimming in the river
>
> Bjorn ended up in the river with his chainmail and a strong current,
> while he can swim he is struggling to reach the shore.
>
> *   He rolls a **65**: Success! The tens digit is 6, so he achieves **6 DoS**. The GM had decided 2 DoS would be enough in this case.

| Difficulty          | Requirement | Description                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**            | 0 DoS       | Routine tasks with no significant pressure.     |
| **Routine**         | 1 DoS       | Standard professional tasks.                    |
| **Challenge**       | 2 DoS       | Demanding tasks requiring focus and skill.      |
| **Hard**            | 4 DoS       | Significant obstacles; requires expertise.      |
| **Extreme**         | 6 DoS       | At the edge of human capability.                |
| **Near Impossible** | 8 DoS       | Practically legendary feats; requires a Master. |

### Advantage & Disadvantage

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage, you roll d100 as normal, but you can swap which die is the primary (tens) and which is the secondary (units). This allows you to choose between two possible results from a single roll.

*   **Advantage**: You select the best result. The **Best Result** is defined as the successful roll that provides the highest **Degree of Success (DoS)**.
*   **Disadvantage**: You must take the worst result.

> ### Example: Advantage Swap
>
> Bjorn (Skill 70) rolls with **Advantage**. He rolls a **2** and a **6**.
>
> *   Option A: **26** (2 DoS)
> *   Option B: **62** (6 DoS)
>
> Bjorn picks **62**. It is still under his skill (70), but it provides a higher DoS.

### Opposing Rolls

When two characters compete (e.g., an arm wrestling match or hiding from a guard), both make a check.

*   **Highest Successful Roll Wins**: If both succeed, the character with the **highest successful roll** wins (Blackjack rules).
*   **Single Success**: If one succeeds and the other fails, the successful character wins.
*   **Double Failure**: If both fail, the situation remains unchanged.
*   **Resisting Effects**: When an ability says "Attribute vs Attribute to resist," it always uses an **Opposing Roll**.

### Pushing the Limit

Before rolling, a player can declare they are "Pushing."

*   **Effect**: You gain **Advantage** on the roll.
*   **Cost**: Regardless of success or failure, you lose **10 Instinct Points (IP)**.

> **Note on Instinct Points**: Instinct Points (IP) represent your character's subconsicous and willpower. They are a pool of points that can be spent to push yourself or are lost when facing horrific sights. If your Instinct Points reach 0, you become Frightened. See **Body & Mind** in Character Creation for how to calculate your maximum IP.


## Character Creation

Character creation is the process of defining your protagonist's strengths, history, and motivations. A character is defined by the following elements:

1.  **Lineage**: Your raw physical and mental potential.
2.  **Body & Mind**: Derived values for health and instinct.
3.  **Heritage**: Your cultural background and innate traits.
4.  **Skills**: Specialized training and knowledge.
5.  **Talents**: Unique abilities and combat maneuvers.
6.  **Combat Styles**: Mastery of specific weapon categories.
7.  **Course of Life**: Your character's history and goals.
8.  **Equipment**: The gear you carry into the wilds.

> ### Example: Character Creation (Bjorn the Brave)
>
> **Step 1: Lineage**: Bjorn chooses **The Bear** totem. Attributes: STR 70, AGI 65, LOG 60, INS 40, CHA 60, CON 65.
>
> **Step 2: Body & Mind**: He calculates 65 HP (equal to CON), 20 IP (INS / 2), and a pool of 6 Reactions (tens digit of AGI).
>
> **Step 3: Heritage**: He picks **Hearth-born**. Trait: Stoic Endurance. Skills: Trained in Survival and Crafting. Gear: A sturdy iron cook-pot.
>
> **Step 4: Skills**: Bjorn is already Trained in Survival and Crafting from his Heritage. He chooses 3 more Trained Skills: Athletics, Warfare, and Perception.
>
> **Step 5 and 6: Talents & Combat Styles**: Bjorn selects the **Shield Wall** Talent and the **One-Handed & Shield** Combat Style.
>
> **Step 7: Course of Life**: Bjorn is a veteran of the Frost Wars, seeking to protect his village from the creeping ice. He is brave but cautious.
>
> **Step 8: Equipment**: Bjorn starts with **60 sp** from his **Hearth-born** heritage. He purchases a Hand Axe (30sp), a bedroll (2sp), a tinderbox (2sp), and 5 days of rations (10sp). He also carries his sturdy iron cook-pot from his heritage, leaving him with **16 sp** for his journey.

## Talents

Talents are special abilities or moves. You gain one at the start of the game and then by spending Experience Points (XP).

### The Talent Pyramid

To ensure a broad base of abilities, you must follow the Talent Pyramid. You cannot specialize in high-tier powers without a foundation of lower-tier skills.

*   **Tier 1**: Cost 5 XP.
*   **Tier 2**: Cost 10 XP.
*   **Tier 3**: Cost 15 XP.
*   **Tier 4**: Cost 20 XP.

> **The Rule of More**: At any time, you must have more talents in a given tier than you have in the tier directly above it. (Common Talents).
> *   Example: To take your first Tier 2 talent, you must have at least two Tier 1 talents. To take a second Tier 2 talent, you must have at least three Tier 1 talents.

> **Archetype Path Rule**: To take an Archetype Talent of Tier 2 or higher, you must already possess at least one talent from that same Archetype in the tier directly below it.

### Common Talents

## Encounters

Combat in Eda is resolved in a series of **Rounds**. Each round represents approximately 10 seconds of in-game time. During a round each combatant take one turn each.

### Initiative

At the start of every round, only the Player Characters (PCs) roll for **Initiative**. Roll a **Check** against your **AGI**.

*   **Vanguard Turn (Success)**: If you succeed, you act before the enemies.
*   **Rearguard Turn (Failure)**: If you fail, you act after the enemies.
*   **Enemies**: All enemies act between the Vanguard and Rearguard turns.
*   **Group Coordination**: Players acting in the same turn (Vanguard or Rearguard) may act in any order they choose.

### Actions

On your turn, you receive **2 Action Points (AP)** and **1 Zero Cost Action**.

#### Standard Actions

*   **Move (1 AP)**: Move a distance up to your **Speed** (AGI / 10 meters).
    *   **Evasive Maneuver**: If you move at least 3 meters during your turn, you gain **Advantage** on all **Active Defense** rolls (Dodge, Parry, Block) until the start of your next turn.
*   **Attack (1 AP)**: Make an attack using a Combat Style.
*   **Help (1 AP)**: Assist an ally within melee range, granting them **Advantage** on their next action.
*   **Interact (1 AP)**: Open a door, light a torch, or manipulate an object.
*   **Swap Weapon (1 AP)**: Draw or sheathe a weapon.
*   **Mount/Dismount (1 AP)**: Get on or off a mount or vehicle.
*   **Stand Up (1 AP)**: Rise from a **Prone** or seated position.
*   **Use Talent/Skill (Variable)**: Use an ability as described in its text (usually 1 AP).
*   **Prepare (1 AP)**: Save an action to be used as a **Reaction** later in the round.

#### The Wait Action
A player in the Vanguard Turn can spend a free Action to Wait. This drops them to the Rearguard Turn, effectively trading initiative for better positioning or observation.

*   **Momentum**: By waiting and observing the enemy, the player gains Momentum. When acting in the Rearguard Turn, they may choose one benefit:
    *   **Precision**: Advantage on their next skill check or attack.

### Damage & Health

*   **Damage**: Total damage is calculated as Weapon Base Damage + Degree of Success (DoS).
*   **Reduction**: Damage is reduced by Defense (Armor/Shields) before being applied to HP.
*   **Death**: At 0 HP.

### Cover
Cover is a vital part of tactical survival. Represents the difficulty of hitting a target partially or fully obscured by the environment.

#### Cover Types
| Type     | Examples                                    | Mechanical Effect                         |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| **None** | Open field, empty hallway.                  | No bonus.                                 |
| **Half** | Bushes, crates, furniture, other creatures. | **Disadvantage** for the attacker.        |
| **Full** | Behind a solid wall, inside a room.         | **Cannot be targeted** by direct attacks. |


### Reactions & Active Defense

Survival in Eda depends on your ability to react to incoming threats. However, physical and mental exhaustion is a factor—characters have a **limited pool of Reactions** for an entire encounter.

*   **Reaction Pool**: Your total pool of Reactions for the **entire encounter** is equal to the **tens digit of your AGI**. (e.g., AGI 65 provides **6 Reactions**).
*   **Finite Resource**: These reactions **do not refresh** every round. Your pool must last for the duration of the entire combat encounter. Use them wisely.

> ### Conserving Your Strength
>
> In Eda, combat is fast and brutal. Because your Reaction Pool is finite, every choice to Dodge, Parry, or Block is a strategic gamble. Once your reactions are spent, you are left completely vulnerable. Players must decide whether to expend their energy early or save it for the enemy's most devastating strikes.

#### Active Defense Options
When you are targeted by an attack, you may spend **1 Reaction** from your pool to perform one of the following:

*   **Dodge (AGI Check - Challenge: 2 DoS)**:
    *   **Success**: You move out of the way. You take **no damage**.
    *   **Failure**: You fail to move in time. You take **full damage**.
*   **Parry (AGI Check)**:
    *   **Success**: You deflect the blow with your weapon. Reduce incoming damage by your **Weapon Damage + DoS**.
    *   **Failure**: Your guard is broken. You take **full damage**.
*   **Block (Shield Skill Check)**:
    *   **Success**: You catch the blow on your shield. Reduce incoming damage by your **Shield Defense + DoS**.
    *   **Failure**: The shield absorbs some impact. You take **half damage**.

## Conditions & Status Effects

Conditions represent various physical, mental, or situational states that can affect a character. Most conditions are temporary, but they can be deadly if ignored.

Fear is a force that erodes your INSTINCT. Anything that causes Fear reduces your current **IP** directly. Unlike HP, IP does not naturally recover without rest or special items. If your IP reaches 0, you gain the condition **Frightened** until you recover your **Maximum IP**.

**Morale Check**: A check to resist fear or intimidation. This is an **Opposing Roll** (e.g., Attacker's CHA vs. Target's INS).

| Condition       | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blinded**     | You cannot see. All your attacks have **Disadvantage**. You automatically fail any check relying on sight. Attackers have **Advantage** on attacks against you.                  |
| **Frightened**  | You are overwhelmed by fear. You have **Disadvantage** on all Skill and Attribute checks. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear.                           |
| **Hidden**      | You are unseen and unheard. You have **Advantage** on your next attack. If you attack or move into the open, the condition ends. See **Stealth** skill for more details.         |
| **Immobilized** | Your movement is restricted. Your **Speed is 0**. You cannot use the **Move** or **The Charge** actions. You have **Disadvantage** on **Dodge** checks.                          |
| **Prone**       | You are lying on the ground. Ranged attacks against you have **Disadvantage**, but melee attacks against you have **Advantage**. Standing up costs **1 AP**.           |
| **Restrained**  | You are **Immobilized** and have **Disadvantage** on all attack rolls. Attackers have **Advantage** on attacks against you.                                                      |
| **Stunned**     | You are momentarily dazed. You cannot take actions or reactions. Attackers have **Advantage** on attacks against you.                                                            |
| **Unconscious** | You are totally unaware of your surroundings. You are **Prone** and **Stunned**. You automatically fail all checks. Any successful attack against you is a **Critical Success**. |


Status effects represent the toll of the environment and biological needs on the body.

| Effect          | Mechanical Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bleeding**    | You are losing blood. Take **2 Damage** at the start of each of your turns. This effect can be stopped with a successful **Medicine** check (**Routine, 1 DoS**) or if you receive any form of healing.                                                                  |
| **Burning**     | You are on fire. Take **2 Damage** at the start of each of your turns. You can spend **1 AP** to attempt an **Agility** check to douse the flames. (**Routine, 1 DoS** for small fires, **Challenge, 2 DoS** for large).                                       |
| **Cold**        | Extreme cold numbs your body. You have **Disadvantage** on all **Agility** checks. If you do not find warmth, you must succeed on a **Constitution** check (**Routine, 1 DoS**) every hour or take **2 Damage**.                                                         |
| **Exhaustion**  | You are physically or mentally spent. **Exhaustion** has 3 levels: <br>1. **Disadvantage** on all Attribute checks. <br>2. **Speed** is halved and **Disadvantage** on all Skill checks. <br>3. You fall **Unconscious**. <br>A full rest removes 1 level of Exhaustion. |
| **Heat**        | Blistering heat drains your stamina. You double your consumption of water. If you do not have water, you must succeed on a **Constitution** check (**Routine, 1 DoS**) every hour or gain 1 level of **Exhaustion**.                                                     |
| **Poisoned**    | Toxins are in your system. You have **Disadvantage** on all **Strength** and **Constitution** checks. Take **1 Damage** at the start of each of your turns unless the poison is neutralized with a **Constitution** check (**Challenge, 2 DoS**).                        |
| **Starvation**  | You lack nourishment. After 3 days without food, you gain 1 level of **Exhaustion** every 24 hours. This cannot be recovered until you eat a full meal.                                                                                                                  |
| **Suffocating** | You cannot breathe. In calm situations, you can hold your breath for **CON / 10** minutes (minimum 1). In high-stress situations (combat), you must succeed on a **Constitution** check every round or gain 1 level of **Exhaustion**. If you reach level 3, you die.    |

## Environmental Hazards

### Falling

Gravity is a lethal foe. When you fall from a height of **3 meters or more**, you take damage upon landing.

*   **Damage**: **5 damage** for every **3 meters** fallen.
*   **Mitigation**: You may attempt an **Acrobatics** check (**Challenge, 2 DoS**) to halve the falling damage.

## Adventuring

### Downtime

During periods of extended peace or between adventures, characters enter Downtime. Provided they have access to settlements or trade hubs, players may spend their currency on equipment, repairs, or lifestyle services. Downtime is also an ideal time for roleplaying personal goals, such as training, research, or tending to wounds.

### Rest & Recovery

#### Normal Rest
A standard rest requires at least 8 hours of sleep. Minor interruptions do not negate the benefits of a rest, provided no significant physical exertion occurs.

*   **HP Recovery**: You recover **4 + (CON Tens Digit) HP** per night of normal sleep.
*   **IP Recovery**: You recover **INS Tens Digit** IP per night of normal sleep.

### Health & Injuries

#### Healing Abilities
Using the **Aid** skill to bandage or splint a broken arm can stop bleeding and prevent an injury from getting worse.

## Equipment & Economy

Currency is based on the weight and purity of precious metals. While many remote clans still rely on barter, most settled areas use a standardized coinage system.

### Denominations

*   **Copper Bit (cp)**: A thin, stamped copper disc used for everyday purchases.
*   **Silver Piece (sp)**: The standard unit of trade. Most goods are priced in Silver Pieces. (100 cp = 1 sp).
*   **Gold Crown (gp)**: Large, heavy coins often dating back long in history. Used only for significant transactions, such as buying land or high-quality livestock. (100 sp = 1 gp).

### Hacksilver & Barter

In the rugged wilds, coins are often rare. Travelers frequently use **Hacksilver**—pieces of silver jewelry, arm-rings, or even coins cut into halves or quarters—which are valued by weight.

Outside major trade hubs, barter is the primary form of exchange. A character might trade a bundle of furs for a night's stay and a hot meal. When haggling over significant trades, the GM may call for a **CHA** or **Appraise** check. Opposing rolls for haggling might occur. 

### Common Goods & Services

## Game Master Section

### Progress Clocks

Progress Clocks are a visual tool used by the Game Master to track the flow of events, the progress of a complex task, or the approaching threat of a looming danger.

A clock is a circle divided into segments—typically 4, 6, or 8. As events unfold, the GM fills in these segments to represent progress.

### Types of Clocks

*   **Objective Clocks**: Used to track the players' progress toward a goal, such as "Sneak into the Fortress" or "Research the Ancient Curse."
*   **Danger Clocks**: Represent a growing threat or a countdown to a negative event, such as "The Guards are Alerted" or "The Ritual Completes."
*   **Linked Clocks**: Sometimes, one clock must be completed before another can begin. For example, a "Find the Secret Entrance" (4 segments) clock might need to be filled before the "Infiltrate the Vault" (6 segments) clock starts.
*   **Mission Clocks**: Track the overall progress of a large-scale operation or adventure.

### Filling a Clock

Segments are usually filled based on the outcome of rolls:

*   **Success**: Fill 1 segment.
*   **Critical Success**: Fill 2 or 3 segments.
*   **Failure on a Risky Action**: The GM may fill 1 or 2 segments on a related **Danger Clock**.

### Why Use Clocks?

Clocks provide transparency and tension. They allow players to see exactly how close they are to success or disaster, making their choices feel more impactful. They are especially useful for situations that shouldn't be resolved by a single roll but require a series of actions.

### Running the Game

This section provides concrete guidance for managing the challenges of Eda at the table.

### Handling Lethality & Success

Eda is a dangerous world. Success is never guaranteed, and failure should always carry weight.

#### The Cost of Failure
Avoid "nothing happens" on a failed roll. Instead, introduce a concrete consequence:

*   **Strength Failure**: You force the door open, but your shoulder is bruised (Lose 1d10 HP) or your crowbar snaps.
*   **Logic Failure**: You decipher the map, but it takes so long that the sun sets, consuming time and light resources.
*   **Agility Failure**: You sneak past the guard, but drop a pouch of **5 sp** that clatters on the stone.

#### Success with a Cost
Sometimes a player fails a roll by a small margin. You can offer them the choice to succeed at a cost.

*   *Example*: "You catch the ledge, but the strain costs you **5 IP** as panic sets in."

### Practical Rules Application

*   **The Art of the Roll**: Only call for a roll when:
    1.  The character is under pressure (time, danger, or social stakes).
    2.  The outcome is uncertain.
    3.  Failure has a concrete consequence.
*   **Narrating Degrees of Success (DoS)**: Use the DoS to describe the quality of the action:
    *   **1 DoS (Routine)**: You get the job done, but it’s messy or takes effort.
    *   **4 DoS (Hard)**: You perform the task with professional grace and efficiency.
    *   **8 DoS (Near Impossible)**: You perform a legendary feat that leaves witnesses in awe.


## Progression

The progression system in Eda rewards failure and provides consistent growth, ensuring low skills improve quickly while high skills plateau.

### The Fumble Points

*   **Trigger**: Your skill improves **immediately** when you roll a **Critical Fumble**.
*   **Definition of Critical Fumble**:
    1. Rolling a **Pair** (11, 22, 33, ..., 00) that is **ABOVE** your Skill Value.
    
    *   *Example*: Skill 45. Roll 77. (Fail + Pair) -> **Fumble**. Skill increases to 46.
*   **The Reward**: When you Fumble, increase that skill by **1 point** permanently. This represents learning from a spectacular failure.

### End of Session

At the end of every session, all players receive **5 Experience Points (XP)**. This represents the general experience and growth gained from adventuring.

**Spending XP:**

*   **Buy Talents**: T1 = 5 XP, T2 = 10 XP, T3 = 15 XP, T4 = 20 XP.
*   **Increase Attributes**: +1 to any Attribute = 10 XP.
*   **Steady Training**: 1 XP increases a trained Skill score by **2 points**.
*   **Unlock Skill**: 5 XP to turn an untrained skill into a Trained skill.
