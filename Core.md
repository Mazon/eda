# Eda

> **Preface**
>
> Winter had arrived, snowflakes gently falling down to the ground. Jonah had finished helping his father put the horses in the stable. It was still not too cold, a wool sweater was enough to hold the cold at bay for now. A river passed by the back side of the house. Jonah walked to get water for dinner. Fog covered the water this morning, reaching out and massaging the grass on each side like fingers playing a beautiful tune on the piano. He bent down to fill up his bucket, something dark suddenly reached out and Jonah was never seen again.

## Introduction

Eda is a dark fantasy game. While still having magic, wonders and amazing adventure. Magic and supernatural things usually have higher consequences both for someone using it and anyone that gets targeted by it.

Living in Eda can be tough and deadly. It was not always this way; once upon a time, the stories tell about a prosperous land where most people lived in peace and harmony. The name Eda itself is said to have meant “Wonderous” in an ancient language long forgotten. Nowadays not many still believe in the legends, and they are mostly whispered quietly over a drink in a dimly lit tavern or hiding in your home.

Common people are scared not only of darkness, monsters, and other creatures roaming the countryside but also of religious fanatics, powerful clans, and corrupt governments. Rulers are often bandits, scoundrels, and men trying to prey on the weak. Then there are diseases, harsh weather, and pests eating the crops. Life is not easy for those trying to do good.

## What is a Roleplaying Game?

A tabletop role-playing game is played with a group of friends. One acts as a **Game Master (GM)**. The rest will take control of a **Player Character (PC)**. The players act through their character and let their character make decisions. The GM will be the world around the players and guide them. Together the players and the GM create a collaborative adventure.

The primary goal is that everyone should have fun. The rules laid out in this book are for guidance only, and your group might feel like changing some aspects to make it more fun.

The game is divided into **Adventures** and **Campaigns**.

*   **Adventure**: A short story or quest.
*   **Campaign**: A series of adventures connected together by a continuing storyline.

## Dice Mechanics

Dice are used to decide outcomes of uncertain actions. Eda uses **two d10 dice** of different colors to represent **01-100**:

*   **Primary Dice**: Represents the 10s (00, 10, 20... 90).
*   **Secondary Dice**: Represents the 1s (0-9).

**Example**: A "70" on the primary and "5" on the secondary equals **75**. Two "0"s equal **100**.

> **Note on Rounding**: When dividing values (e.g., Skill / 2), always **round down**. Example: 75 / 2 = 37.

## Game Sessions

It is up to the group to decide how long to play, but a general tip is to keep sessions around **4-5 hours** for both getting into stories but at the same time not play on fumes but everyone is different so do what is most fun for you and your group.

**Session 0**: It is always a good idea to have a first session where you don’t adventure fully but make sure everyone has a character created, backstories are done, and expectations are set regarding the tone of the game.

# Playing the Game

## Checks

Roll **2d10** (01-100).

*   **Success**: Roll **UNDER** or EQUAL to your Skill/Attribute.
*   **Failure**: Roll **OVER** your Skill/Attribute.
*   **Critical Success**: Doubles under skill (11, 22, 33...). A Critical Success deals **Max Damage**: Weapon Base Damage + tens digit of the Skill (e.g., 70 Skill = +7). This replaces the normal damage calculation for that hit.
    *   **Difficulty Bypass**: In non-combat checks, a Critical Success automatically fulfills the required Degrees of Success for any difficulty level.
*   **Degree of Success**: The value of the primary die (tens digit). For example, a roll of 48 grants 4 Degrees of Success.

## Difficulty Modifiers

| Difficulty          | Requirement (DoS) | Description                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Easy**            | 0 DoS             | Routine tasks with no significant pressure.     |
| **Routine**         | 1 DoS             | Standard professional tasks.                    |
| **Challenge**       | 2 DoS             | Demanding tasks requiring focus and skill.      |
| **Hard**            | 4 DoS             | Significant obstacles; requires expertise.      |
| **Extreme**         | 6 DoS             | At the edge of human capability.                |
| **Near Impossible** | 8 DoS             | Practically legendary feats; requires a Master. |

## Advantage & Disadvantage

*   **Advantage**: Roll twice, take the **best** result (lowest number).
*   **Disadvantage**: Roll twice, take the **worst** result (highest number).

## Opposing Rolls

When two characters are competing against each other (e.g., an arm wrestling match or trying to hide from a guard), both parties make a check.

*   Both roll against their respective Skill/Attribute.
*   If both fail, nothing happens or the situation remains unchanged.
*   If one succeeds and the other fails, the successful character wins.
*   If both succeed, the character with the **highest successful roll** wins.

# Character Creation

## Skills

Skills represent your character's training and experience.

After that you can increase your skills by using XP. Only trained skills can be improved by XP. To "unlock" an untrained skill into a trained skill you need to spend **5 XP** at once, representing dedicated training. After that, you can increase the skill score using XP.

### Cover Types
| Type      | Examples                                    | Mechanical Effect                         |

## Reactions & Active Defense
Survival depends on your ability to react to incoming threats. Characters have a **limited pool of Reactions** for an entire encounter. **Reactions**: Calculated as **(MND / 2)**. Use the **tens digit** of the result as your total pool of Reactions for the **entire encounter**. (Example: MND 55 / 2 = 27.5, which gives **2 Reactions**). 
These do not refresh every round and must be used strategically.
